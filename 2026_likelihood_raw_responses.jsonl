Need to evaluate each description for plausibility.\n\nWe must consider factual accuracy: are the people real, organizations, relationships plausible. Many are obscure or possibly fictional. If a person is real and the scenario is plausible (e.g., a former Secret Service agent joining a college basketball team? That seems unlikely). But we need to assess plausibility, not certainty. If impossible (e.g., a 1975-born footballer ending membership with a college basketball team? Could be but unlikely). We need to decide.\n\nWe need to decide possible_in_2026: false only if absolutely impossible (e.g., person dead before 2026, organization doesn't exist, etc.). Many names may be fictional, but not impossible. So likely possible_in_2026 = true for most, with varying likelihood.\n\nWe need to evaluate each.\n\nLet's go through each id:\n\n1. Clint Hill, former Secret Service agent, ended membership with Arkansas-Pine Bluff Golden Lions men's basketball team on Jan 1 2026. Is there a person named Clint Hill? Yes, Clint Hill was a Secret Service agent who protected LBJ, born 1932, would be 94 in 2026, unlikely to be a member of a college basketball team. So scenario is implausible (impossible? He could be a staff advisor? But \"membership\" as player? Not possible). So likely impossible. So possible_in_2026 = false, likelihood \"impossible\". Rationale: Clint Hill would be far beyond playing age; unlikely to be member.\n\n2. Jan Zelenka joined German Research Foundation as a new member. The DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) is a funding organization; membership is not typical; individuals are not \"members\". Could be a board member? Possibly but \"new member\" ambiguous. Could be plausible if he is a researcher. Not impossible. Likelihood maybe low to medium. Let's set possible true, likelihood \"low\". Rationale: DFG does not have general membership; joining as member is unlikely but not impossible.\n\n3. Ravi Sreenivasan left AIIMS New Delhi. Ravi Sreenivasan is a known Indian physician, currently alive. Leaving AIIMS is plausible. Likelihood medium-high. So possible true, likelihood \"medium\". Rationale: Senior faculty may retire or move.\n\n4. Emmanuel Duchemin no longer a member of AS Nancy Lorraine. Emmanuel Duchemin is a former French footballer, retired. Being a \"member\" of a club (maybe staff) could end. Plausible. Likelihood medium. possible true.\n\n5. Piotr Osinski set to start membership with ACF Fiorentina on Jan 1 2026. Piotr Osinski? Not known as footballer. Could be a player? Not known. Could be fictional. But a player joining Fiorentina is plausible. Likelihood low to medium. possible true.\n\n6. Marius Høibråten leaving Lillestrøm SK on Jan 1 2026. Marius Høibråten is a Norwegian footballer, currently playing for another club (maybe Rosenborg). Leaving Lillestrøm is plausible if he was there earlier. Actually he played for Lillestrøm earlier? He played for Lillestrøm earlier? He played for Lillestrøm 2012-2015, then moved. So leaving again improbable. But could be rejoined then leave. Not impossible. Likelihood low.\n\n7. Edwin Johnson joined German Research Foundation as member Jan 1 2026. Similar to #2, generic name. Not impossible but unlikely. Likelihood low.\n\n8. Fabrizio Ravanelli started playing NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Jan 1 2026. Fabrizio Ravanelli is a former Italian footballer born 1968, would be 58 in 2026, cannot play NCAA basketball (eligibility rules require amateur status and age limits). So impossible. possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n9. Ian J Orland no longer working for University of Wisconsin–Madison Jan 1 2026. Could be a staff leaving. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n10. Alexander Shishkin joins FC Barcelona Handbol (handball) Jan 1 2026. Alexander Shishkin is a Russian handball player born 1995, plausible to join Barcelona. Likelihood medium-high.\n\n11. Alessio Tesi parts ways with University of Florence Jan 1 2026. Could be a professor. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n12. Matt Read no longer member of University of Western Ontario Jan 1 2026. Matt Read is a Canadian ice hockey player, not academic. Could be a staff? Unlikely but possible. Likelihood low.\n\n13. Miloš Belák joins U.S. Cremonese Jan 1 2026. Miloš Belák is a Slovak footballer, plausible to join Italian club. Likelihood medium.\n\n14. Derek Phillips (footballer born 1975) ends membership with Boston University Terriers men's basketball team Jan 1 2026. Derek Phillips age 51, unlikely to be playing basketball. Could be a coach? But \"membership\" ambiguous. Likely impossible as player. But could be a staff. However description says footballer. So improbable. Likelihood low? Might be impossible as player. We'll mark possible false? Might be impossible. Let's set possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n15. Paul Evans no longer member of Shamrock Rovers FC Jan 1 2026. Paul Evans is a common name; could be a player or staff. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n16. Tad Willoughby joined Sint-Truidense V.V. Jan 1 2026. Not known name, but plausible. Likelihood low-medium.\n\n17. Edward F. Harry joined Long Island Rough Riders Jan 1 2026. Not known, but plausible for lower division soccer. Likelihood low.\n\n18. Ján Leško joins King's College London Jan 1 2026. Ján Leško is a Slovak footballer, joining a university? Could be as student or staff. Unlikely but possible. Likelihood low.\n\n19. Anis Boussaïdi parts ways with Club América Jan 1 2026. Anis Boussaïdi is a Tunisian footballer born 1975, would be 51, unlikely to be playing. Could be staff. But \"parted ways\" plausible as retirement. Likelihood low-medium.\n\n20. Robbie Crawford (footballer born 1993) joins Mitsu, Okayama Jan 1 2026. Robbie Crawford is a Scottish footballer, could join Japanese club. Mitsu? Not sure club name; maybe \"Mitsubishi\" but plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\nNow produce JSON with id as string.\n\nWe need to ensure each result includes id as string (so \"1\", \"2\", etc).

Could be plausible). Some are clearly impossible: Gennadi Matveyev with Soviet Union national football team (Soviet Union dissolved 1991, no team in 2026). So impossible.\n\nAlso Edwin Holliday in NHL; Edwin Holliday is a former English footballer born 1939, would be 86 in 2026, unlikely to be playing. So impossible.\n\nMarko Perković is a Croatian singer, not basketball player. So unlikely. Could be a different person with same name, but improbable. Likelihood low? Probably impossible? Since it's a known public figure, unlikely to join college basketball at age ~45? Marko Perković born 1966, would be 60 in 2026. So impossible.\n\nSimilarly, Raphaël Guerreiro is a Portuguese footballer, not FC Lorient (he plays for Bayern Munich as of 2024). Could transfer to Lorient?

I'd say low (since unknown person). Provide rationale.\n\n22: Muriel Orlando leaving Tigres UANL (Mexican football club). Muriel Orlando not known. Could be plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n23: Hua Liao starting at Colegio Nacional Iquitos (a school in Peru). Could be plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n24: Gennadi Matveyev leaving Soviet Union national football team. Impossible because team doesn't exist. So possible_in_2026 = false, likelihood impossible.\n\n25: Suzanne Z. Kanatsiz leaving Weber State University. Could be plausible (faculty). Likelihood low.\n\n26: Andrei Zakharenko leaving FC Torpedo-BelAZ Zhodino (Belarus club). Could be plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n27: Derk Droze leaving Ølstykke FC (Danish club). Could be plausible.

Could join Lorient then leave? Unlikely. But plausible that he could be at Lorient and leave. Likelihood medium.\n\n29: Caroline A Blackshields leaving Cork Institute of Technology. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n30: A. J. Ratliff leaving Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team. A.J. Ratliff is a former basketball player born 1985, would be 41 in 2026, not on college team. So impossible. Unless it's a different person with same name, but unlikely. I'd mark impossible.\n\n31: Edwin Holliday's tenure in NHL ends Jan 1 2026. Edwin Holliday is a footballer, not NHL. Also age. Impossible.\n\n32: Xiaolu Pang leaving HKUST. Plausible (faculty). Likelihood low.\n\n33: Rubén Lorca joining University of Amsterdam. Plausible (academic).

Apalikova starting at Lincoln City FC Jan 1 2026. Could be plausible (footballer). Likelihood low.\n\n38: Tyler Miller leaving US U-23 soccer team Jan 1 2026. Tyler Miller is a US goalkeeper born 1993, age 33 in 2026, could be out of U-23 (age limit). He would be too old for U-23 anyway; U-23 is for players under 23, so he would have left earlier.

Johnathan Loyd (born 1995) played for Oregon Ducks, graduated 2018. By 2026 he would be 31, could still be on team? Unlikely as NCAA eligibility limited to 4 years.

Likelihood low.\n\n57: Dean Andretta joins UC Irvine Anteaters men's basketball team. Unknown, plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n58: Saša Bjelanović no longer member of University of Southern Mississippi. Saša Bjelanović is a Croatian footballer born 1973, retired. Not a member of university. Could be staff? Unlikely but not impossible. Could be a professor? Not known. Likelihood low.\n\n59: Silvia Bolzani joins Hull F.C. Hull F.C. is rugby league club. Silvia Bolzani unknown; could be plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n60: Brian van Goethem leaves Roompot–Charles. Roompot–Charles is a Dutch cycling team that disbanded in 2020.

I'd assign low plausibility.\n\nSimilarly \"Thomas Thompson, notable cricketer\" leaving Cumbria County Cricket Club; plausible.\n\n\"Sean Floyd\" joining Georgia Southern Eagles men's basketball staff; plausible.\n\n\"Jeff Bierly\" no known player; plausible.\n\n\"Elisabetta Punta\" leaving University of Genoa; plausible.\n\n\"Guillaume Vincent\" leaving Pierre and Marie Curie University; plausible.\n\n\"Darren Rice\" joining ADO Den Haag (football club) as member; plausible.\n\n\"Sylvain Le Gall\" leaving University of Lorraine; plausible.\n\n\"Nancy Peña\" joining La Trobe University; plausible.\n\n\"Nicky White\" leaving England national rugby league team; plausible.\n\n\"Gurgen Sahakyan\" joining PFC Beroe Stara Zagora; plausible.\n\n\"Sergei Aleinikov\" leaving Federal University of Paraíba; plausible (though name Russian, could be professor).\n\n\"Faruk Hujdurović\" leaving SV Ried; plausible (he is a former footballer, retired; leaving as staff maybe plausible).\n\n\"Serhiy Morozov\" born 1950 leaving U.S. Lecce; unlikely as player; maybe staff; but description says \"membership\". I'd mark low.\n\n\"Thomas Thompson\" cricketer leaving club; plausible.\n\n\"Dan Burk\" leaving University of Minnesota system; plausible.\n\n\"Elliot Käck\" joining Democrats of the Left (Italian? Swedish?) Party; plausible.\n\n\"Oscar Scott\" joining Eintracht Braunschweig II; plausible.\n\n\"Delonte Taylor\" leaving UC Riverside basketball; plausible.\n\n\"Shamrock\" joining LSU Tigers basketball; name ambiguous; plausible.\n\n\"Pierluigi Casolaro\" leaving INFN Napoli; plausible.\n\nNow assign likelihood categories: If plausible, maybe \"high\" if no issues. If some minor uncertainty, \"medium\". If low plausibility, \"low\". If impossible (e.g., date mismatch, person dead), \"impossible\". Check any contradictions: \"January 1 2026 is Thursday\" matches. So all dates okay.\n\nCheck \"Sean Floyd\" staff start on Thursday Jan 1 2026; plausible.\n\n\"Guillaume Vincent\" last day scheduled for Thursday Jan 1 2026; okay.\n\n\"Faruk Hujdurović\" is a former footballer born 1972, retired; could be staff; plausible.\n\n\"Serhiy Morozov\" born 1950, would be 76; unlikely to be player; but could be coach; description ambiguous; I'd set low.\n\n\"Thomas Thompson\" cricketer; unknown age; plausible.\n\n\"Shamrock\" maybe a nickname; but plausible.\n\nThus possible_in_2026 = true for all except maybe if impossible. All are possible.\n\nNow assign likelihood:\n\n81 Jeff Bierly leaving basketball team: likely plausible, high.\n\n82 Sean Floyd joining staff: high.\n\n83 Edith F. Marley leaving med school: high.\n\n84 Elisabetta Punta leaving University of Genoa: high.\n\n85 Guillaume Vincent leaving Pierre and Marie Curie University: high.\n\n86 Darren Rice joining ADO Den Haag: high (assuming player or staff).

Since he's retired, leaving may be staff; plausible. I'd set medium.\n\n93 Serhiy Morozov leaving U.S. Lecce: low.\n\n94 Thomas Thompson leaving Cumbria County Cricket Club: medium? Not sure about age; but plausible; set medium.\n\n95 Dan Burk leaving University of Minnesota system: high.\n\n96 Elliot Käck joining Democrats of the Left: medium? Political party membership is plausible; but \"Democrats of the Left\" is an Italian party that dissolved in 1998. So joining in 2026 impossible. Actually \"Democrats of the Left\" (Democratici di Sinistra) existed 1998-2007 in Italy. So cannot join in 2026. So impossible. possible_in_2026 = false, likelihood \"impossible\". Rationale: party no longer exists.\n\n97 Oscar Scott joining Eintracht Braunschweig II: high.\n\n98 Delonte Taylor leaving UC Riverside basketball: high.\n\n99 Shamrock joining LSU Tigers basketball: high.\n\n100 Pierluigi Casolaro leaving INFN Napoli: high.\n\nNow produce JSON with id as string (convert numbers to strings).

We need to decide if scenario is impossible (e.g., person dead, age unrealistic). Let's examine each.\n\nWe need to know about each person:\n\n141: Ivan Zvyagin - not sure if real footballer. Could be a Russian player. FC Khimik Dzerzhinsk is a Russian club (lower division). It's plausible a player leaves. No contradictory info. Likelihood: medium? It's plausible. So possible_in_2026 = true, likelihood maybe medium (common transfers). Rationale: plausible.\n\n142: David Ahern leaving Tiverton Town FC. David Ahern maybe not known; Tiverton Town is English non-league. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n143: Mark O Cunningham joins Paris Saint-Germain. PSG is top club; Mark O Cunningham unknown. If he's a high-profile player, unlikely. Could be a youth or staff? The description says \"joined the ranks\". Could be unrealistic if not a known player. Likelihood low. Not impossible, but low.\n\n144: Jordon Mutch parting ways with NK Dravograd. Jordon Mutch is an English footballer born 1989, currently playing for some club? He hasn't played for NK Dravograd (Slovenian club). Could be plausible if he transferred earlier. By 2026 he would be 37, could still be playing. Leaving a lower-tier club plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n145: Derek Stokes no longer a member of Huddersfield Town AFC. Derek Stokes is a former English footballer born 1939, died 2022? Actually Derek Stokes (born 1939) died 2022? I think he passed away. If dead, cannot be member. So impossible. possible_in_2026 false, likelihood impossible.\n\n146: Miha Kline no longer a member of England national under-19 football team as of Jan 5 2026. Under-19 team players must be under 19. Miha Kline? Not known. Could be a youth player. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n147: Cláudia S Constantino joins FC Winterthur. Could be a female player? FC Winterthur is Swiss club with men's and women's teams. Name plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n148: Jayaram Lakshmaiah Narayana ends membership with German Research Foundation (DFG). DFG is a funding organization; individuals are not members. Could be a board member? But \"membership\" unusual. Likely implausible. But not impossible if he was a member of some committee. Likelihood low.\n\n149: Odeon Kino becomes a member of German Research Foundation. Odeon Kino is a cinema chain, not a research organization. Membership impossible. So impossible.\n\n150: Abhishek Bhandawat leaving Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology. Plausible academic staff leaving. Likelihood medium.\n\n151: Jimmy Robertson, footballer born 1944, joins New Mexico Lobos men's basketball team in 2026. He would be 82 years old. Unlikely to take a role (maybe as coach?). Could be a staff role, but description says \"taken on a new role\" ambiguous. Could be a consultant. But \"new role with the team\" maybe as a coach? At 82, possible but low. Likelihood low but not impossible.\n\n152: László Ovári parts ways with Free University of Berlin. Could be a professor. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n153: Lafayette Dorsey no longer a member of Pacific Tigers men's basketball team as of Jan 6 2026. Pacific Tigers is college team; players are college age. Lafayette Dorsey unknown. Could be a player who left. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n154: Nate Bailey departs Pittsburgh Panthers Men's Basketball as of Jan 6 2026. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n155: Paulo Freire, a renowned astronomer, parts ways with Cornell University as of Jan 7 2026. Paulo Freire is a famous educator (died 1997). Not an astronomer. So impossible (the name refers to a deceased person). Could be another person with same name, but \"renowned astronomer\" not matching known. Likely impossible. We'll mark impossible.\n\n156: Tanju Kayhan parts ways with Mersin İdman Yurdu as of Jan 7 2026. Tanju Kayhan is a Turkish footballer born 1995, currently playing maybe elsewhere. Could leave. Likelihood medium.\n\n157: Anastasia Shuppo no longer a member of ZFK Zenit Saint Petersburg as of Jan 7 2026. ZFK Zenit is women's team. Name plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n158: Sergey Troyanov departs Moscow State University on Jan 9 2026. Plausible academic. Likelihood medium.\n\n159: Cédric Fabien no longer a member of Tours FC as of Jan 9 2026. Cédric Fabien is a French footballer born 1982, would be 44 in 2026, unlikely still playing but could be staff. Leaving as player improbable. Likelihood low.\n\n160: Kornelius Normann Hansen leaves Southampton F.C. as of Jan 10 2026. Kornelius Normann Hansen is a Norwegian footballer born 1999, currently at Southampton? He was at Southampton earlier? Actually he played for Southampton's youth. Could leave.

But if the organization doesn't have such a role (e.g., NCAA Division I Men's Basketball is a league, not a team; individuals \"departing\" from NCAA is vague). But plausibility: a player ending college career is plausible. However some names like \"Dana Mcguffin\" not known as FC Basel player (FC Basel is Swiss soccer club, not typical for a person named Dana Mcguffin).

So not impossible.\n\nCheck timeline: dates in Jan 2026 are plausible.\n\nReal-world plausibility: Could these events happen? Yes, unless contradictory (e.g., \"Josh Davis, basketball player born 1980, part ways with Wyoming Cowboys basketball team\" - Wyoming Cowboys is a college team; a 46-year-old player in 2026 unlikely to be playing.

Likelihood: medium (since plausible but unknown). possible_in_2026 true.\n\n182: Josh Davis, basketball player born 1980, part ways with Wyoming Cowboys basketball team as of Jan 17 2026. Age 46, unlikely to be a player. Could be a coach, but description says player. So impossible. possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n183: Ivey no longer participating in NCAA Division I Men's Basketball as of Jan 17 2026. No first name, could be a player. Plausible.

Since we have no evidence, I'd assign \"low\" for generic plausible events? But we can differentiate: for typical roster changes, likely (high). But we don't know if person exists. I'd set \"low\" for generic plausible but uncertain. However the instruction: \"likelihood\" indicates chance of scenario happening. Since we have no data, we can assign \"low\" for most, \"medium\" for more likely (e.g., typical staff changes). Let's simplify: assign \"low\" for all plausible ones, except maybe \"high\" for those that are routine (e.g., player leaving after season). But we can just use \"low\" across board.\n\nBetter: Use \"low\" for all plausible events, \"impossible\" for impossible ones.\n\nThus:\n\n181: possible true, likelihood low, rationale: plausible roster change.\n\n182: false, impossible, rationale: a 46‑year‑old would not be a college basketball player.\n\n183: true, low.\n\n184: true, low.\n\n185: true, low.\n\n186: true, low.\n\n187: true, low.\n\n188: true, low.\n\n189: true, low.\n\n190: false, impossible.\n\n191: true, low.\n\n192: true, low.\n\n193: true, low.\n\n194: true, low.\n\n195: true, low.\n\n196: true, low.\n\n197: true, low.\n\n198: true, low.\n\n199: true, low.\n\n200: true, low.\n\nNow produce JSON with results array in order, each object with id as string (so convert numeric id to string).

Otherwise possible true, assign likelihood based on plausibility.\n\nWe must consider each:\n\n221: Miroslav Kasaj - unknown. German Research Foundation (DFG) is a funding organization, membership? DFG has members? Typically scientists are members of DFG? Not typical; DFG is not a membership organization. Could be a board member. But plausible? Might be unrealistic. But not impossible. Likelihood low.\n\n222: Anna Danesi leaving an unspecified organization. No specifics, plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n223: Ken Hicks joining Team Manzana Postobón. Manzana Postobón is a Colombian cycling team (now defunct?). It was a pro cycling team that folded 2022. By 2026, maybe not exist. So joining a defunct team impossible. So possible_in_2026 false, likelihood impossible.\n\n224: Alexander Schur no longer a member of FSV Frankfurt as of Jan 26 2026. Alexander Schur is a former German footballer, retired. Could be a staff member? He could be a member (player) but by 2026 he'd be 50+. Not a player. Could be staff. But plausible that he was a member and left. Likelihood low.\n\n225: Emmanuel I Unuabonah joining Nîmes Olympique. Not known player. Could be plausible. Likelihood low-medium.\n\n226: Janusz Wojewoda joining Morgan State Bears men's basketball team. Janusz is Polish name, could be a player? NCAA eligibility? By 2026, age? Unknown. Could be a coach. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n227: Vladimir Petrović (footballer born 1972) leaving Fortuna Düsseldorf. He would be 54 in 2026, unlikely as player but could be staff. Could be plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n228: László Lovász leaving LASK. Lovász is a famous mathematician, not a footballer. LASK is Austrian football club. Unlikely he was a member. So impossible? Could be honorary? But \"member\" ambiguous. Likely impossible. So possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n229: Ken Randle joining Zhejiang Professional FC. Unknown. Could be plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n230: Sosha Makani no longer a member of Naft Tehran FC. Sosha Makani is Iranian goalkeeper, born 1984, would be 42 in 2026, could still be player but unlikely. Could be leaving. Plausible. Likelihood low-medium.\n\n231: Nobby Clark, renowned footballer, leaving Queen of the South FC. Nobby Clark (born 1954) would be 72 in 2026, not a player. Could be staff? Unlikely. Probably impossible. So false.\n\n232: Jimmy Ines no longer a member of German Research Foundation. Jimmy Ines unknown. DFG membership improbable. But could be a researcher. Plausible low.\n\n233: Mark O' Connor joining CD Santa Clara. Mark O'Connor (footballer) maybe? Could be plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n234: Flávia Gonçalves Fernandes leaving University of Uberaba. Could be a professor. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n235: Tarn P Drylie joining Tufts Medical Center. Unknown but plausible staff. Likelihood low.\n\n236: Evaristo Beccalossi no longer a member of German Research Foundation. Beccalossi is former Italian footballer, not a researcher. Impossible. So false.\n\n237: Yuta Baba leaving Pordenone Calcio. Yuta Baba (Japanese footballer, born 1984) would be 42, could be leaving. Plausible low.\n\n238: Matt Carkner joining JEF United Chiba. Matt Carkner is a Canadian former hockey player, retired. Joining Japanese football club improbable. Impossible.\n\n239: Daniel C. Elias leaving University of Manchester. Could be staff. Plausible.\n\n240: Nuno Gomes (born 1978) leaving S.C. Campomaiorense. Nuno Gomes retired, would be 48. Could be staff. Plausible low.\n\nNow assign likelihood categories: \"impossible\" for definitely impossible. \"low\" for plausible but unlikely. \"medium\" for fairly plausible. \"high\" for very likely.\n\nWe'll set possible_in_2026 true for all except those impossible.\n\nImpossible cases: 223 (defunct team), 228 (Lovász not football), 231 (Nobby Clark age), 236 (Beccalossi), 238 (Carkner).

Actually England national rugby union team is men's; women's is England women's rugby union team. Raija Laiho is a Finnish name; unlikely to join England men's team.

Unlikely due to nationality and gender. Could be a coach? Not specified. Likelihood low. possible true.\n\n303: Matthieu Boulo joining Santos FC (Brazilian football club). Matthieu Boulo is a French footballer born 1989, currently playing lower leagues. Could join Santos? Unlikely but possible. Likelihood low-medium. Let's set low.\n\n304: Dominique Schafer at University of Rhode Island ending tenure. Could be professor. Plausible.

Homa Majd sounds female; Australia men's team unlikely. Also no known player. Likelihood low.\n\n311: Dennis Sørensen leaving FC Vestsjælland. FC Vestsjælland dissolved in 2015.

He is a Mexican footballer; plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n317: Jean-Louis Beffa leaving Staffordshire County Cricket Club. Jean-Louis Beffa is a French businessman, not a cricket staff. Unlikely but could be a sponsor? Probably impossible? He is retired. Likelihood low but possible? He could be on board.

It's a funding organization, not typical membership; but could be staff. \"Neville Bannister is no longer a member of the German Research Foundation\" - plausible if he was staff.

Provide JSON with results array in same order. For each, determine possible_in_2026 (true if not impossible). Likelihood categories: impossible, low, medium, high. Provide concise rationale (<=2 sentences). Need to consider factual accuracy: Are the people real? Many names may be obscure; we can't verify all. If unknown, assume plausible unless clearly impossible (e.g., a known person who cannot be in that role). Also timeline: Feb 1 2026 is a Sunday? Let's check: 2026-02-01 is a Sunday? 2026 is not a leap year. Jan 1 2026 is Thursday (2025 was not leap, 2025 Jan 1 Wed? Actually 2024 is leap, 2025 Jan 1 Wed, so 2026 Jan 1 Thu). Then Jan has 31 days, so Feb 1 is Sunday? Jan 1 Thu, Jan 31 Sun (since 30 days later). So Feb 1 is Monday? Wait: Jan 1 Thu, Jan 2 Fri, Jan 3 Sat, Jan 4 Sun, Jan 5 Mon, Jan 6 Tue, Jan 7 Wed, Jan 8 Thu, Jan 9 Fri, Jan 10 Sat, Jan 11 Sun, Jan 12 Mon, Jan 13 Tue, Jan 14 Wed, Jan 15 Thu, Jan 16 Fri, Jan 17 Sat, Jan 18 Sun, Jan 19 Mon, Jan 20 Tue, Jan 21 Wed, Jan 22 Thu, Jan 23 Fri, Jan 24 Sat, Jan 25 Sun, Jan 26 Mon, Jan 27 Tue, Jan 28 Wed, Jan 29 Thu, Jan 30 Fri, Jan 31 Sat. So Feb 1 is Sunday? Actually Jan 31 is Saturday, so Feb 1 is Sunday. Yes, correct. So date matches Sunday.\n\nThus timeline plausible.\n\nNow each scenario: joining or leaving teams/universities. Generally plausible. Some may be impossible due to NCAA eligibility: e.g., \"John Canzano is no longer a member of the Penn Quakers men's basketball team\". John Canzano is a known sports journalist, not a basketball player. So impossible that he was a member. So likely impossible. Similarly, \"John Vandecar has joined the German Research Foundation as a member\". John Vandecar is a known academic (maybe a dean at University of Arkansas). Could join DFG? DFG membership is for institutions, not individuals; but there are DFG review panels. Might be plausible but unlikely. But not impossible.\n\n\"Soslan Takazov\" unknown; could be a basketball player.

She is a cyclist; plausible.\n\n\"Dorota Kmiec leaving King's College London\" plausible.\n\n\"Ignacio de León leaving North York Astros\" North York Astros is a Canadian soccer club (defunct?). The club folded in 2014. So impossible in 2026.

Some may be obscure. If person likely exists? If unknown, we can assume plausible. The scenario is about employment changes on Feb 1 or 2 2026. Generally plausible unless impossible (e.g., a deceased person, or organization that no longer exists). Also check timeline: Feb 1 2026 is a Sunday? Let's verify: 2026-02-01 is a Sunday indeed (2026 is not leap year; Jan 1 2026 is Thursday, so Feb 1 is Sunday). So dates align.\n\nCheck each:\n\n401: Felix Theska at UNSW.

NCAA eligibility limited to 4 years; by 2026 he would be far beyond. So \"no longer a member\" is plausible (he already left). But scenario says he leaves on Feb 1 2026. Could be plausible if he was a graduate assistant? But as a player, impossible. Likelihood low? Actually it's impossible for him to be a player in 2026. So scenario of him leaving is impossible because he wouldn't be a member. So possible_in_2026 false, likelihood impossible.\n\n404: Gongqiang Li at UT Southwestern Medical Center. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n405: Gurpreet Singh footballer with Churchill Brothers FC Goa (Indian club). Could be plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n406: Joanna C Robson with 1. FK Drnovice (Czech football club). Not sure if women's team? Could be plausible. Likelihood low-medium.

If the scenario is impossible (e.g., person dead before 2026, organization doesn't exist, date impossible like March 1 2026 is a Sunday?

Let's quickly check: 2024 Jan 1 Monday (since 2023 Dec 31 Sunday). 2024 is leap, so 2025 Jan 1 Wednesday. 2025 not leap, so 2026 Jan 1 Thursday. Then days to March 1: Jan 31 days, Feb 28 days (2026 not leap). So Jan 1 Thu, Jan 31 adds 30 days => Thu +30 = Sat (since 28 days is 0 mod 7, 30 mod7=2). So Jan 31 is Saturday. Feb 28 adds 28 days => Saturday +28 = Saturday. So Feb 28 is Saturday. March 1 is Sunday. So March 1 2026 is indeed Sunday. So date matches.\n\nThus many statements about starting/ending on March 1 2026 are plausible.\n\nNow evaluate each:\n\n561: Peter F. Brussard joins German Research Foundation (DFG).

The question: \"If the scenario is absolutely impossible in 2026, then possible_in_2026 = false, otherwise true.\" So we need to decide absolute impossibility. For Ken Thompson leaving DFG: not impossible, just unlikely. So possible_in_2026 = true, likelihood low.\n\nWe need to evaluate each.\n\nLet's go through items:\n\n581: Ken Thompson no longer a member of German Research Foundation as of March 1 2026. Ken Thompson (computer scientist) is not known to be a member of DFG; DFG membership is institutional. Could be a member of DFG's council? Not typical. But not impossible. Likelihood low.\n\n582: Nabanita Mukherjee joined Deportivo Alavés (Spanish football club). Nabanita Mukherjee sounds like Indian name, not known footballer. Could be staff? \"member\" ambiguous. Could be a player? Unlikely but possible as staff. Likelihood low.\n\n583: Gene Dyker joined FAO as a member. Not known person. Could be staff. Likely possible. Likelihood medium.\n\n584: Richard Keogh (real footballer, born 1986) joining Quimper Kerfeunteun F.C. (French lower division). He is a professional defender, could transfer to lower league. By 2026 he'll be 40, maybe still playing in lower leagues. Possible. Likelihood medium.\n\n585: Rodney Hamilton part ways with Georgia State Panthers men's basketball team. Rodney Hamilton is a real former player and coach, currently assistant? Could leave. Likely possible. Likelihood medium.\n\n586: Dunson no longer a member of Drake Bulldogs men's basketball team. No first name, ambiguous. Could be a player. Possible. Likelihood medium.\n\n587: Ralph P. Maguire ends tenure at University of Groningen. Unknown person. Could be staff. Possible. Likelihood medium.\n\n588: Jade I Fostvedt leaves University of South Dakota. Unknown person. Possible. Likelihood medium.\n\n589: Saad Al-Yami joins Kjøbenhavns Boldklub (Danish football club). Saad Al-Yami is a Saudi footballer (born 1990) currently playing elsewhere. Could join Danish club? Possible but unlikely. Likelihood low.\n\n590: Jaime Moreno (footballer born 1995) parts ways with El Palo FC. Jaime Moreno is a Bolivian footballer born 1974, not 1995. There is a younger player maybe. But the description says born 1995, could be a different person. El Palo FC is a Spanish lower division. Could happen. Likelihood medium.\n\n591: Rajesh R Zalte to start working for SV Eintracht Trier 05 on March 1 2026. Unknown person. Could be staff. Likelihood medium.\n\n592: Mátyás Herein leaves University of Hamburg. Unknown. Possible. Likelihood medium.\n\n593: Laura Silveira Moriyama leaves Universidade Nove De Julho (Brazil). Unknown. Possible. Likelihood medium.\n\n594: Samuel N Pagliarini ceased to be employed by Carnegie Mellon University as of March 1 2026. Unknown. Possible. Likelihood medium.\n\n595: Riku Hakulinen parts ways with Åbo Akademi University as of March 1 2026. Unknown. Possible. Likelihood medium.\n\n596: James Davis announced departure from NCAA Division I Men's Basketball effective March 1 2026. Could be a player graduating. Possible. Likelihood medium.\n\n597: John Lynch's collegiate basketball career ended March 1 2026. Could be a player. Possible. Likelihood medium.\n\n598: Kim Jong-song will no longer be a member of Júbilo Iwata as of March 1 2026. Kim Jong-song is a North Korean name; could be a player? Not typical. But possible as foreign player. Likelihood low.\n\n599: Jamie Burns joined German Research Foundation as a new member March 1 2026. German Research Foundation membership is institutional; individuals are not members. So impossible? Could be a member of the council? Not typical. Likely impossible. So possible_in_2026 = false, likelihood impossible.\n\n600: André Gohr set to leave Funvic/Soul Brasil Pro Cycling on March 1 2026. Unknown person, could be a rider. Possible. Likelihood medium.\n\nNow assign likelihood categories: \"impossible\", \"low\", \"medium\", \"high\". Most are low or medium. None high.\n\nWe need concise rationale <=2 sentences.\n\nNow produce JSON with \"results\" array in same order.\n\nMake sure id as string. So convert numeric id to string.\n\nLet's craft each entry.\n\n581: possible true, likelihood low, rationale: Ken Thompson is a senior computer scientist and not typically a member of the German Research Foundation; while not impossible, such affiliation is unlikely.\n\n582: possible true, likelihood low, rationale: Nabanita Mukherjee is not known as a professional footballer, making a playing role at Deportivo Alavés improbable, though a non‑playing staff position could occur.\n\n583: possible true, likelihood medium, rationale: The FAO hires staff from various backgrounds, so Gene Dyker joining as a member is plausible.\n\n584: possible true, likelihood medium, rationale: Richard Keogh, aged 40 in 2026, could move to a lower‑division French club like Quimper Kerfeunteun FC.\n\n585: possible true, likelihood medium, rationale: Rodney Hamilton has held coaching positions and could part ways with Georgia State Panthers in 2026.\n\n586: possible true, likelihood medium, rationale: Without a first name, Dunson could be a player or staff leaving the Drake Bulldogs, which is a routine roster change.\n\n587: possible true, likelihood medium, rationale: Academic staff turnover is common; Ralph P. Maguire leaving the University of Groningen is plausible.\n\n588: possible true, likelihood medium, rationale: Jade I. Fostvedt ending her appointment at the University of South Dakota fits normal academic departures.\n\n589: possible true, likelihood low, rationale: Saad Al‑Yami, a Saudi footballer, moving to a Danish club is unlikely but not impossible.\n\n590: possible true, likelihood medium, rationale: A footballer born in 1995 could leave a lower‑tier Spanish side like El Palo FC in 2026.\n\n591: possible true, likelihood medium, rationale: Rajesh R. Zalte starting at SV Eintracht Trier 05 is a plausible career move for a lower‑league player.\n\n592: possible true, likelihood medium, rationale: Staff changes at universities are routine; Mátyás Herein leaving Hamburg is plausible.\n\n593: possible true, likelihood medium, rationale: Laura Silveira Moriyama departing Universidade Nove De Julho aligns with typical academic turnover.\n\n594: possible true, likelihood medium, rationale: Employment termination at Carnegie Mellon University for Samuel N. Pagliarini is plausible.\n\n595: possible true, likelihood medium, rationale: Riku Hakulinen ending his affiliation with Åbo Akademi University is a normal academic change.\n\n596: possible true, likelihood medium, rationale: College athletes regularly finish their eligibility; James Davis leaving NCAA Division I basketball in 2026 is plausible.\n\n597: possible true, likelihood medium, rationale: John Lynch concluding his NCAA basketball career on that date is a typical graduation scenario.\n\n598: possible true, likelihood low, rationale: Kim Jong‑song joining a Japanese club is rare, but a foreign player contract ending in 2026 is not impossible.\n\n599: possible false, likelihood impossible, rationale: The German Research Foundation does not have individual “members”; individuals cannot join as described.\n\n600: possible true, likelihood medium, rationale: André Gohr leaving the Funvic/Soul Brasil Pro Cycling team on March 1, 2026 is a standard contract termination.\n\nNow produce JSON.

Mahsa Fardisi unknown, but could be a staff. Plausible. Likelihood low? Since unknown person but plausible. So true, low.\n\n603: Joe Mccray joining Pakhtakor Tashkent FK. Unknown person, plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n604: Dorota Zięba-Przybylska joining Brazil U-23 national team. She would be age? Not known. Could be a player; but U-23 implies age <=23. If she is older, impossible. Unknown.

Henderson, American Bandmasters Association (ABA). Is there a known person? I don't recall. Could be fictional. Membership changes plausible. Even if person not real, could be a real person unknown. Likelihood maybe low but possible. So possible_in_2026 = true, likelihood low.\n\n642: Tarik Celik, OpTic Gaming. Tarik Celik is a known esports player (Turkish). He was with OpTic?

Likelihood low.\n\n644: Jim Robbins, Ole Miss Rebels Men's Basketball. I don't recall a player named Jim Robbins. Could be fictional. Likelihood low.\n\n645: Rumen Rangelov, POFC Botev Vratsa (Bulgarian football club). Rumen Rangelov is a Bulgarian footballer, played for Botev Vratsa? He is a real player. Leaving in 2026 plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n646: Hady Khashaba, Egypt national under-20 football team. Not known. Could be plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n647: Maria Luísa Costa, European University of Lisbon. Not known. Could be plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n648: Giovanni Bodini joins Al Hilal SFC (Saudi football club). Not known. Could be plausible.

There is a former player/coach named Edgar \"El Tigre\" Henríquez? Actually Edgar Henríquez is a Salvadoran football manager, former player. He could be part of national team staff. Leaving plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n651: Jun Chen, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics. Could be a researcher. Plausible. Likelihood low-medium.\n\n652: Marcelo Quinteros, Boca Unidos (Argentine football club). Marcelo Quinteros is an Argentine footballer, retired. He could be staff. Leaving plausible but he retired earlier. Might be improbable but possible. Likelihood low.\n\n653: Gaia Tortolina, Cagliari Calcio. Not known. Could be fictional. Likelihood low.\n\n654: Tosayamada, Kōchi replacing itself. This is a municipality in Japan that merged into a larger city in 2005 (Tosayamada merged into Kami). The statement about \"replacing itself\" is nonsense. Impossible. So possible_in_2026 = false, likelihood impossible. Rationale: municipality cannot replace itself.\n\n655: Denis Klinar, Slovenia national under-21 football team. Denis Klinar is a Slovenian footballer, but he is senior national team, not U21.

Provide concise rationale <=2 sentences.\n\nWe need to assess factual accuracy: are the people real? Some may be obscure. Many are likely real athletes or staff. If person doesn't exist, scenario impossible. Let's check quickly:\n\n- Tomáš Klinka: I don't recall a footballer with that name. Could be fictional. If fictional, scenario impossible? The instruction: factual accuracy: Are the people, organizations, relationships realistic and plausible? If person not real, scenario impossible. So likely many are fictional. But we can consider possibility that they could exist as unknown individuals. However, they are specific names; many could be real but obscure. For evaluation, we assume if not known publicly, still plausible they exist. The question: \"general plausibility by 2026 (not certainty)\". Even if person unknown, it's plausible they exist. So likely most are possible. However, some contradictions: dates mismatched (e.g., description says departure on March 17 but article date earlier). That's fine.\n\nWe need to assess timeline feasibility: dates are in March 2026, which is future but plausible.\n\nReal-world plausibility: Could these transfers happen? Yes, players change clubs. So likely possible.\n\nThus likely all are possible with varying likelihood. Likelihood maybe low for obscure or unlikely moves (e.g., a 60-year-old researcher leaving). But still possible.\n\nWe can assign \"high\" for typical sports roster changes, \"medium\" for academic staff changes, \"low\" for obscure or improbable combos.\n\nLet's go through each:\n\n681: Tomáš Klinka parts ways with FK Viktoria Žižkov (Czech club). If Tomáš Klinka is a real player? Not known. Could be plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n682: Sören Järelöv started working for Næstved Boldklub (Danish club). Could be plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n683: Natalie Calatayud leaving San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research. Could be plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n684: Onismor Bhasera (real Zimbabwean footballer) leaving Plymouth Argyle F.C. He played there previously? He was at Plymouth earlier (2015-2017). By 2026 he would be 38, could still be there but unlikely. Likelihood low.\n\n685: Steven W Purtle leaving Brigham and Women's Hospital. He is a real physician? Possibly. Likelihood medium.\n\n686: Wilber Sánchez leaving América Managua (Nicaraguan club). Could be plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n687: Mikyla Grant-Mentis leaving Merrimack Warriors women's ice hockey. She is a real player, currently pro. Leaving college team plausible (graduation). Likelihood high.\n\n688: Donell Grier leaving Stetson Hatters men's basketball. He is a real player, could be plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n689: Carlos Ocaña Morgner leaving NYU. Not known, plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n690: Peter Short joining FC Dordrecht (football club). Peter Short is a rugby player? Actually Peter Short is a rugby union player from New Zealand. Joining a Dutch football club is unlikely. Likelihood low.\n\n691: Torashi Shimazu departs JEF United Chiba (Japanese club). Not known, plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n692: Feride Bakır parts ways with Bayer 04 Leverkusen women's team. She is a Turkish footballer, plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n693: Charles W Sanders leaves North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission. Plausible.

Likelihood categories: impossible, low, medium, high. Since it's plausible, maybe high. But some may be less plausible due to age (e.g., older players). For example, Billy Muffett - if he's a real person? There's a Billy Muffett who was a pitcher born 1930, died 2008. So impossible for him to be a player in 2026. So that scenario is impossible.

Actually Jan 1 2024 is Monday. 2024 leap adds 2 days, so Jan 1 2025 is Wednesday. 2025 normal adds 1 day, so Jan 1 2026 is Thursday).

So same weekday as Jan1: Thursday. So March 26 2026 is Thursday. Description says Thursday, matches.\n\nCheck March 27 2026: add 1 day => Friday. Many descriptions say Friday, matches.\n\nMarch 28 2026: Saturday. Some say Saturday? Not many.\n\nMarch 29 2026: Sunday. Some say Sunday, matches.\n\nMarch 30 2026: Monday.

Provide JSON with results array in same order. For each, determine possible_in_2026 (true unless impossible). Likelihood categories: impossible, low, medium, high. Need concise rationale <=2 sentences.\n\nWe must assess factual accuracy: are the people real? Many names may be obscure or possibly fictional. If a person is not known to exist, but could be a real person? The instruction: \"Base the judgment on general plausibility by 2026 (not certainty).\" If a name is unknown, but could be a real person, it's plausible. However if the organization doesn't have such a role (e.g., \"Rick Minkwitz\" on New Hampshire Wildcats men's basketball team - could be plausible as a player? Not known but could be a student-athlete). So likely possible.\n\nBut some may be impossible: e.g., \"Francesco Margiotta is no longer a member of Kharkiv National University of Radioelectronics as of March 31, 2026.\" Francesco Margiotta is a professional footballer (Italian) born 1992, unlikely to be a member of that Ukrainian university. Could be improbable but not impossible (maybe he studied there). Likelihood low.\n\nWe need to assign likelihood: impossible if scenario cannot happen (e.g., a person who died before 2026 cannot be member). Check if any person is known deceased before 2026. For example, \"Bob Sykes\" baseball player? Not known. Could be alive. \"Gary Vandermolen\" unknown. \"Jean-Clément Texier\" unknown. \"Oscar Filho\" is a Brazilian comedian, alive. Could join football club? Unlikely but possible as a player? He is not a footballer. So joining Venezia F.C. as a member (maybe staff) improbable but not impossible. Likelihood low.\n\nWe need to be consistent.\n\nWe'll go through each id.\n\n781: Rick Minkwitz - unknown. Could be a player on New Hampshire Wildcats (University of New Hampshire). Plausible. Likelihood high (normal roster change). possible_in_2026 true.\n\n782: Oswaldo Salgado - Real Cartagena (Colombian football club). Could be a player. Plausible. Likelihood medium-high. possible true.\n\n783: Bob Sykes, baseball player, St. Louis Cardinals. Could be a player; plausible. Likelihood medium. possible true.\n\n784: Prabhjot Saini joins Doncaster Rovers F.C. Could be a footballer; plausible. Likelihood medium. possible true.\n\n785: Ming Zhang parts ways with Xi'an Jiaotong University. Could be a professor; plausible. Likelihood high. possible true.\n\n786: Louise A.

Likelihood high.\n\n790: Christy Elliot leaves Scotland national rugby union team. Could be a player; plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n791: Mehmet Ilicak leaves Uni Health. plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n792: Krzysztof Pawlak leaves Akron Zips men's basketball team. Could be a coach or player; plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n793: Seungjoon Oh joins US Dax (French rugby club). plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n794: Jean-Clément Texier starts work for organization in Tonami, Toyama (Japan). Could be any job; plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n795: Francesco Margiotta leaves Kharkiv National University of Radioelectronics. Since he's a professional footballer, unlikely to be a member of that university. Could be a guest lecturer? Very low likelihood. possible true but low.\n\n796: Andy Leaf joins Real Zaragoza. Could be a player; plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n797: Jamie Warren ends NCAA Division I Men's Basketball career. Could be a player; plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n798: Oleksii Tyshchenko leaves German Research Foundation. Could be a researcher; plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n799: Oscar Filho joins Venezia F.C. He is a comedian, not a footballer. Could join as staff or ambassador, but \"member\" ambiguous. Low likelihood but possible.\n\n800: Frederick Goldstein leaves Northamptonshire County Cricket Club. Could be a player; plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\nNone are impossible. So possible_in_2026 = true for all.\n\nNow assign likelihood categories: high for routine academic or staff changes? The categories are about likelihood of scenario happening. For typical roster changes, high. For unlikely cross-field (footballer leaving Ukrainian university, comedian joining football club) low.\n\nLet's assign:\n\n781 high\n782 medium (player leaving club is common, but unknown player; medium)\n783 medium\n784 medium\n785 high\n786 high\n787 medium\n788 medium\n789 high\n790 medium\n791 medium\n792 medium\n793 medium\n794 medium\n795 low\n796 medium\n797 high\n798 medium\n799 low\n800 medium\n\nNow craft rationale <=2 sentences.\n\nWe'll produce JSON.\n\nNeed id as string.

Need to assess each description's plausibility.\n\nAll items are about sports personnel changes, university affiliations, a location relocation, a product discontinuation. Need to consider realism: Are the people real? Many names may be fictional. If fictional, scenario could still be plausible (someone could join a club). The question: \"Factual Accuracy: Are the people, organizations, and relationships mentioned realistic and factually plausible?\" If the person is unknown, but could exist, it's plausible. If organization exists, plausible. If the scenario is impossible (e.g., GE U28CG never existed, or product discontinued but maybe unrealistic date?), we need to decide.\n\nWe need to evaluate each.\n\nGeneral approach: Most are plausible: player transfers, staff hires, university membership, etc. Even if the person is not known, it's plausible they could join. So possible_in_2026 = true for most. Likelihood: maybe low to medium because unknown. But we need to assign categories.\n\nWe must be concise.\n\nLet's go through each id:\n\n821: Benjamin Bellot no longer member of FC Sachsen Leipzig. FC Sachsen Leipzig was dissolved in 2011? Actually there is a club FC Sachsen Leipzig that was dissolved, but there is a successor? Might be defunct. So a player being member in 2026 improbable because club not active. So likely impossible. So possible_in_2026 false, likelihood impossible.\n\n822: Dick Brott joined University of Aberdeen as a member. Could be a staff or researcher. Plausible. Likelihood medium (unknown person). possible true.\n\n823: Zach Marbury left UCSI University. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n824: Taye Taiwo (real former footballer) joining CSF Bălți (Moldovan club). He is retired, but could join as player? He is 39 in 2026, maybe unlikely but possible as a veteran. Likelihood low.\n\n825: Davit Kokhia left Halifax Town AFC. Halifax Town A.F.C. exists (English non-league). Player plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n826: Jaime F Blanck left HB Køge (Danish club). Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n827: C.J. Cooper left U.S. Gavorrano (Italian club). Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n828: Scott Donaldson start working for California Golden Bears men's basketball team. Could be a coach. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n829: Churovichi ceased to be located in Klimovsky District. This sounds like a settlement relocation. Could happen? Possibly administrative change. Likelihood low but plausible.\n\n830: Yohei Sakai joins RBC Roosendaal (Dutch club). Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n831: Juan Eleder Acedo Elorriaga leaves Barakaldo CF (Spanish club). Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n832: Maria Molas started being a member of the German Research Foundation (DFG). DFG is a funding organization; membership? Could be a board member. Plausible. Likelihood low-medium.\n\n833: Philip Shambrook joins FK Zora (maybe a club). Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n834: General Electric ceased production of GE U28CG. Does GE U28CG exist? GE made locomotives like U28C, not U28CG (maybe a variant). Might be fictional. If product never existed, impossible. Likelihood impossible.\n\n835: Don Buchman no longer member of Academia Sinica. Could be a researcher. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n836: Angel Arias leaves Tokyo Verdy (Japanese club). Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n837: Blake L Jones joins SC Bastia (French club). Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n838: Jayfred Godoy joins France national football team. National team members are top players; unknown name likely not. Could be a staff? It says membership, ambiguous. Likely implausible for unknown person to be player. Likelihood low but possible as staff. We'll say possible true, likelihood low.\n\n839: Deon Jones leaves Monmouth Hawks men's basketball. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n840: Tammi Wilson joins Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles men's basketball as staff. Plausible.

Only impossible if contradictory (e.g., a person cannot be a member because organization doesn't exist, or date impossible). All dates are April 15 2026, which is a Wednesday? Let's verify: 2026-04-15 day of week. 2026 is not a leap year. Use known: 2024-02-29 is Thursday? Actually 2024 is leap year. Let's compute quickly: 2025-01-01 is Wednesday? Let's use known: 2024-01-01 was Monday (2024 is leap year). Then 2025-01-01 is Wednesday (since 2024 had 366 days, shift 2 days). 2026-01-01 is Thursday (shift 1 day). Then days to April 15: Jan 31, Feb 28 (2026 not leap), Mar 31, Apr 15 = 31+28+31+15 = 105 days. 105 mod 7 = 0 (since 98 is multiple, remainder 7). Actually 105/7=15 exactly, remainder 0. So April 15 2026 is also Thursday (since Jan 1 Thursday + 0 days = Thursday). Wait check: Jan 1 Thursday, add 104 days (since Jan1 counts as day0). 104 mod7 = 6, so Thursday +6 = Wednesday? Let's compute properly: Jan1 = Thursday. Jan2 Friday (1), Jan3 Saturday (2), Jan4 Sunday (3), Jan5 Monday (4), Jan6 Tuesday (5), Jan7 Wednesday (6). So Jan7 is Wednesday. After 7 days cycles. So after 105 days (including Jan1?), Let's just use known: April 15 2026 day of week? Quick internet mental: 2026-04-15 is Wednesday? Let's verify using known 2025-04-15 was Tuesday (since 2025 not leap, 2024-04-15 was Monday? Actually 2024-04-15 was Monday (2024 leap year). Then 2025-04-15 Tuesday, 2026-04-15 Wednesday.

Some may be impossible: e.g., Danijel Popović, a renowned footballer, joining Oregon Health & Science University School of Medicine as a member (maybe as a student?

Tania Calvo is a real Spanish cyclist, she rides for \"Euskadi-Murias\"? Not sure. Eustrak-Euskadi maybe fictional. But plausible that she could leave a team. Likelihood: medium.\n\n985: Kingsley Edwards joins Argentina national football team.

So possible_in_2026 false, likelihood impossible.\n\nSimilarly, some names may be fictional or unknown; we assume plausible unless contradictory.

But could be a different person with same name; ambiguous. We need to assess plausibility: if name matches known person with age making scenario unlikely, we can assign low or impossible?

If a person is clearly impossible (e.g., born 1923 joining a football club in 2026 at age 103), that's impossible. Others like Anthony Brown (common name) could be a basketball player; South Bay Lakers is G League team; plausible he could leave. So possible.\n\nWe need to decide likelihood: based on typical turnover, plausible but uncertain. Use low/medium/high.\n\nLet's go through each id.\n\n1021: Anthony Brown, basketball player, no longer member of South Bay Lakers as of April 27 2026. South Bay Lakers is G League affiliate of LA Lakers. Players often change. Anthony Brown is a real NBA player (born 1992) currently with Detroit Pistons as of 2024. By 2026 could be on G League? plausible. Likelihood of leaving by that date is medium-high. So possible_in_2026 true, likelihood medium (since plausible but uncertain). Rationale: Player movements common.\n\n1022: Juvenal, renowned footballer born 1923, joins Yeovil Town F.C. in 2026 at age 103. Impossible. So possible false, likelihood impossible. Rationale: Age makes it impossible.\n\n1023: Luz María González-Robledo parting ways with Southern Miss Golden Eagles basketball team. Need to check if such person exists. Not known; could be a coach or staff. Could be plausible. Likelihood low-medium. We'll set possible true, likelihood low (since unknown). Rationale: No known record but staff changes happen.\n\n1024: Shane Hierman time in NCAA Division I Men's Basketball ends April 27 2026. Not known; plausible. Likelihood medium. possible true.\n\n1025: Johan Elmander tenure with Sweden national under-21 football team ends April 27 2026. Johan Elmander born 1979, retired, would be 47 in 2026, cannot be under-21 player. Could be a coach? But description says member of team, likely player. So impossible. possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n1026: Michael Halford joins LPR cycling team April 28 2026. LPR (formerly a pro team, dissolved 2014). If revived? Not known. Could be fictional. Likelihood low but possible if team exists. We'll set possible true, likelihood low.\n\n1027: Jordan Taylor, professional basketball player, joins Daejeon Hana Citizen (Korean football club?) Actually Daejeon Hana Citizen is a football (soccer) club in South Korea. A basketball player joining a soccer club is unlikely unless it's a basketball team? There is Daejeon Hana Citizen basketball? Actually there is a basketball team called \"Daejeon Hana Citizen\" in Korean Basketball League? I think Hana Financial Group sponsors both football and basketball. There is a basketball team \"KCC Egis\"? Not sure. But plausible that a basketball player could join a Korean basketball club with similar name. However Daejeon Hana Citizen is primarily football. So improbable. But not impossible if they have a basketball division. Likelihood low. possible true.\n\n1028: Tim Crossin no longer member of Towson Tigers men's basketball team as of April 28 2026. Tim Crossin is a real former player (born 1995). By 2026 he would be 31, could be a coach or staff. Leaving team plausible. Likelihood medium. possible true.\n\n1029: Malik M Abdullah no longer member of Radio y Televisión de Andalucía as of April 28 2026. Not known; plausible employee leaving. Likelihood low-medium. possible true.\n\n1030: Michael Coghlan no longer member of Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders men's basketball team as of April 28 2026. Michael Coghlan maybe a player; by 2026 could be graduate. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1031: Larry Rainey's tenure with Seaham Red Star F.C. ends April 28 2026. Seaham Red Star is a non-league English club. Larry Rainey maybe a player; plausible. Likelihood low-medium.\n\n1032: Gastón A. Pizzio parts ways with Technical University of Valencia as of April 28 2026. Could be a professor; plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n1033: Sowmya Sivasankaran parts ways with IIT Madras as of April 28 2026. Could be faculty; plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n1034: Danny Gosset no longer member of Rhyl F.C. as of April 28 2026. Danny Gosset is a Welsh footballer (born 1994). By 2026 age 32, could still be playing; leaving plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1035: Hikaru Mita tenure with FC Locomotive Tbilisi ends April 28 2026. Not known; plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n1036: Nodar Akhalkatsi no longer member of Japan national under-23 football team as of April 28 2026. Nodar is a Georgian name; could be a player, but under-23 implies age <=23. If Nodar is older, impossible. Unknown age. Likely impossible unless he's a coach. Description says member, ambiguous. We'll treat as player; likely impossible. But we have no age. Could be a young Georgian playing for Japan U23? Unlikely due to nationality rules. So improbable. We'll set possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n1037: Csaba Csizmadia ends membership with German Research Foundation as of April 29 2026. Csaba Csizmadia is a Hungarian footballer, not a researcher. Membership with DFG unlikely. So impossible. possible false.\n\n1038: Gary Yoder joins SV Mattersburg as of April 29 2026. SV Mattersburg is Austrian football club that was dissolved in 2020, reformed? Actually SV Mattersburg declared bankruptcy 2020; a new club maybe. Could be plausible if reformed. Gary Yoder unknown. Likelihood low but possible. We'll set possible true, likelihood low.\n\n1039: Naby Twimumu no longer member of FC Swift Hesperange as of April 29 2026. Naby Twimumu is a Luxembourgish footballer (born 1990). By 2026 age 36, could still be playing. Leaving plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1040: Nhlanhla Khuzwayo set to start working for Slovakia national football team on April 30 2026. Nhlanhla Khuzwayo is a South African former goalkeeper (born 1990). Working for Slovakia team as coach maybe plausible. Likelihood low-medium. possible true.\n\nNow assign likelihood categories:\n\n- impossible: for 1022, 1025, 1036, 1037.\n\n- low: 1023, 1026, 1027, 1029, 1031, 1032, 1033, 1035, 1038, 1040 maybe low.\n\n- medium: 1021, 1024, 1028, 1030, 1034, 1039.\n\n- high: maybe none.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nNeed each result object with id as string (so convert number to string). possible_in_2026 boolean, likelihood string, rationale <=2 sentences.\n\nLet's craft rationales.\n\nProceed to final."}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2825, "prompt_tokens": 1961, "total_tokens": 4786, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null, "kv_transfer_params": null}

Let's compute: Jan 1 2026 Thursday. Days to May 1: Jan 31, Feb 28, Mar 31, Apr 30 = 120 days. Add 120 days to Thursday: 120 mod 7 = 1 (since 119 is multiple of 7). So May 1 is Friday.

He played for Hallescher FC earlier. Could leave in 2026. Likelihood medium.\n\n- Jack Penhall: Not known; Rutgers basketball player. Could leave.

Unlikely a politician to become a football player. So impossible? Could he join as staff? But description says \"part of the VVV-Venlo team\". Could be as staff but improbable. Likelihood low? I'd say impossible because career mismatch and age (63). So possible_in_2026 false, likelihood impossible.\n\n1102: Javaris Crittenton - former NBA player, born 1987, currently incarcerated? Actually he was convicted of murder in 2011, sentenced to 10 years, released 2021? Not sure. Red Army Faction is a German far-left terrorist group disbanded in 1998.

Probably low to medium. We'll set possible true, likelihood low (since unknown). Rationale: No evidence of his existence, but such a departure is plausible.\n\n1104: Alexandre M. Carmo - unknown; could be academic at Oxford. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n1105: Claire Mcmaster - unknown; Athletic Bilbao is a Spanish football club that only signs male players (women's team exists?). Athletic Bilbao has women's team; could join. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n1106: Jerry Johnson baseball player - there is a Jerry Johnson (pitcher) born 1995, MLB? Actually there is a Jerry Johnson (basketball). Not sure. Could be plausible that he leaves Giants. Likelihood medium.\n\n1107: Laurent de Palmas - former French footballer, retired, born 1977. AS Cannes is a lower division club; could be staff? But as player unlikely at age 49. Could be non-player role. Description says \"member\". Could be plausible but unlikely. We'll set low.\n\n1108: Rodrigo, footballer born 1991, but \"German Research Foundation\" (DFG) is a research funding body, not a club. Unlikely a footballer is member. Impossible.\n\n1109: Jens Bochert - unknown; FC Rapid București is Romanian football club. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n1110: William J. Martin - unknown; Bolton Wanderers F.C. plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n1111: Barbara Głowińska-Olszewska - unknown; pursuing a Diploma (maybe high school). Plausible.

Some items involve \"City of Carlisle\" joining a football club, which is odd: a city cannot be a member of a club. That seems implausible. Also \"History of Valle d' Aosta Calcio\" seems weird but could be a club. \"University of Milan\" joining a person plausible. \"Rot-Weiss Essen\" is a German football club; Dan Boyle is a known ice hockey player (former NHL). Could he join a German football club? Unlikely but not impossible (could change sport). But plausibility low. \"Matt Haddrell\" unknown. \"Southern Utah Thunderbirds men's basketball team\" plausible. \"SD Amorebieta\" is a Spanish football club; Peng Li could be a player; plausible.\n\n\"UCF Knights men's basketball team\" losing Marouan Zarrouk plausible.\n\n\"Luciana Marti departs Duke University\" plausible.\n\n\"Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball team\" losing Mike Rolf plausible.\n\n\"Melanie A.

I'd set low.\n\n1163: Colombia becomes a member of King's College London. Countries cannot become members of a university. Impossible. So possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n1164: Gary Robson, a footballer, started being a member of the Portland State Vikings men's basketball team. A footballer joining a college basketball team is unlikely, especially as a member (player). Also Portland State Vikings are NCAA Division I. A professional footballer switching sports at age? Not impossible but highly implausible. Also \"member\" ambiguous. I'd say unlikely but not impossible? Could be a former footballer playing basketball? Age unknown. I'd set possible true? But scenario seems implausible. I'd assign low likelihood.\n\nBut we need possible_in_2026 true if not impossible.

So possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n1169: Darryl Young no longer member of Eastern Kentucky Colonels men's basketball team as of May 1 2026. Darryl Young is a former NBA player, retired. Could be a coach? But as a player, unlikely. But could be a staff. The description says member of team, ambiguous. Could be plausible that he was a student-athlete? Age? He was born 1979, would be 47. Not plausible as player. Likelihood low but not impossible if he was a staff. I'd set possible true, likelihood low.\n\n1170: Niklaas J.

Not plausible as player. Could be staff. Likelihood low but possible. So true, low.\n\n1175: Thomas Ambrosius started being a member of Rīgas Vef on May 1 2026. Rīgas VEF is a Latvian basketball club. Could be plausible. True, likelihood medium.\n\n1176: Ruben Santiago set to leave Facultad De Ciencias, part of Universidad Autónoma De Madrid, effective May 1 2026. Plausible academic departure.

If a person is not known to be associated with that organization, but could plausibly join/leave, it's not impossible. However if the scenario is absurd (e.g., a university joining a national football team) that's impossible.\n\nLet's go through each.\n\n1181: Marc Andre Fortin no longer a member of Sam Houston Bearkats men's basketball team as of May 3, 2026. Sam Houston Bearkats is a college team (Sam Houston State University). Marc Andre Fortin? Not known as a player; could be a coach? But plausible that a person leaves a college team. Not impossible. Likelihood: low to medium? Since no known person, but plausible. I'd say low (unlikely but possible). possible_in_2026 = true.\n\n1182: Virginia Marugan-Hernandez part ways with Royal Veterinary College - Hawkshead Campus. Royal Veterinary College is in London; \"Hawkshead Campus\" maybe not existent. Could be fictional campus. If campus doesn't exist, scenario impossible. There's no Hawkshead Campus. So impossible. possible_in_2026 = false, likelihood \"impossible\". Rationale: campus doesn't exist.\n\n1183: Chris Carberry set to depart from Australia national rugby union team effective May 4, 2026. Chris Carberry is a former Australian rugby player, now older (born 1951). He would be 75 in 2026, not a player. Could be a coach/administrator? But \"membership\" ambiguous. Likely impossible for him to be a member as a player. Could be staff, but not indicated. Probably impossible. So false, impossible.\n\n1184: Erik Rush departure from NCAA Division I Men's Basketball effective May 4, 2026, ending playing career. Erik Rush is a real player (born 2002). In 2026 he'd be 24, could still be playing college? NCAA eligibility limited to 4 years, usually finish by age 22. By 2026, he would have exhausted eligibility, so departure plausible (he's done). So possible. Likelihood medium (since typical). possible_in_2026 true.\n\n1185: Kirill Sukhoversha part ways with FC Yakutiya Yakutsk as of May 4 2026. FC Yakutiya Yakutsk is a Russian football club (maybe exists). Kirill Sukhoversha? Not known, but plausible. So true, likelihood low-medium. I'll set low.\n\n1186: Hakan Cengiz no longer a member of VfB Oldenburg as of May 4 2026. VfB Oldenburg is a German club. Hakan Cengiz? Not known, but plausible. true, low.\n\n1187: Noriya Uedo leaving Osaka International Cancer Institute as of May 4 2026. Person unknown, institute exists. plausible. true, low.\n\n1188: Silvino Intra Moreira has joined the German Research Foundation as a member on May 5 2026. DFG is a funding organization; \"member\" maybe as a board member. Person unknown but plausible. true, low.\n\n1189: Germán Cano no longer a member of Club Atlético Lanús as of May 5 2026. Germán Cano is an Argentine striker, currently playing for a club (maybe Boca Juniors). He could transfer. plausible. true, medium.\n\n1200: Chuck Barker joined Palermo F.C. as new member on May 8 2026. Palermo FC is Italian club. Chuck Barker unknown but plausible. true, low.\n\nNow other items:\n\n1190: Pat McKenna, footballer, part ways with St Johnstone F.C. as of May 5 2026. Pat McKenna is a Scottish former footballer born 1973, retired. By 2026 he would be 53, not playing. Could be staff? Not indicated. Likely impossible as player. So impossible.\n\n1191: Julián Guillermo no longer a member of Club Atlético Banfield as of May 5 2026. Not known; plausible. true, low.\n\n1192: Francesco Antonioli part ways with Modena F.C. 2018 as of May 5 2026. Francesco Antonioli is a goalkeeper born 1969, retired. By 2026 age 57, not playing. Could be staff, but not indicated. Likely impossible. So false.\n\n1193: Chandrasekhar Kambhampati set to leave University of Reading, last day May 6 2026. He is a professor (space scientist) currently at University of Arizona? Actually K. Chandrasekhar Kambhampati is a professor at University of Arizona. Could be at Reading? Not likely but possible he moves. Plausible. true, low.\n\n1194: Prasanna Jagannathan joined ÍBV men's football as new team member as of May 6 2026. Prasanna Jagannathan is a researcher, not footballer. Unlikely but could be a staff? \"team member\" ambiguous. Could be a player? Unlikely. But not impossible for a person to switch careers. Likelihood low. true.\n\n1195: Iuliu Hațieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy set to start a new membership with the France national football team on May 6 2026. A university joining a national football team is absurd. Impossible. false.\n\n1196: Mie Lillethorup's tenure at Aarhus University ends May 8 2026. Person unknown but plausible. true, low.\n\n1197: Abhay Dokania part ways with Delft University of Technology as of May 8 2026. plausible. true, low.\n\n1198: On May 8 2026, an individual started working for Guayaquil City F.C.

Rationale: While she could be an affiliate, it's unlikely for a musician to become a member of IIASA.\n\n1244 Stéphanie Allassonnière - medium (academic leaving polytechnique plausible). Rationale: Academics often change institutions; departure is plausible.\n\n1245 Teresa G Nunes - medium (staff joining Florida A&M basketball team plausible).

Current knowledge cutoff 2024-06, but we can reason.\n\nID 1261: Ricky Shumway, BYU Cougars men's basketball team. Is there a player named Ricky Shumway? I am not aware. Could be fictional. BYU Cougars men's basketball roster includes players, but not known. Could be a walk-on. Could be plausible that a player leaves team. Likelihood: low to medium? Since unknown, but plausible.

Modena F.C. 2018 is an Italian football club (soccer). Rugby player joining a soccer club as employee? Could be a staff role, but \"team\" suggests player. Unlikely. Also John O' Shea not known. Likelihood low. possible true. Rationale: Unlikely crossover but not impossible.\n\nID 1263: Nityananda Chowdhury ends affiliation with Penn State World Campus. I don't know this person; could be staff. Plausible. Likelihood medium. possible true.\n\nID 1264: Štefan Chrtianský, born 1989, volleyball player, leaves Nantes Rezé Métropole Volley. Could be plausible; European volleyball players change clubs. Likelihood medium-high. possible true.\n\nID 1265: Louise Mensch leaves News Corp. Louise Mensch is a British author, former MP, writes for various outlets, has been a columnist for The Daily Mail, not News Corp. She could have been employed by News Corp (owner of Fox, etc).

But name matches former president; improbable he works at a small company. Likelihood low, but possible if it's a different person. We'll treat as low.\n\nID 1269: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander no longer member of Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team. Shai GA is NBA player, never played for Kentucky; he played at Kentucky? Actually he played at Kentucky? He was at Kentucky for one season (2020-21) then drafted. By 2026, he would be NBA star, not college.

Shon Cooks is a college basketball player at Alabama State (maybe). He could graduate or leave. Plausible.

So possible true.\n\n1282: Lisanne Meis, not known; Tv Fischbek? Possibly a local TV station? Not known. Could be fictional. But plausible that a person leaves a TV station. No impossibility. Likelihood low due to obscurity but possible. So true.\n\n1283: Chris Hornbrook, known as drummer for band, not basketball. Not a basketball player. Indiana State Sycamores men's basketball team: unlikely that Chris Hornbrook (born 1977) would be a player. So impossible. possible_in_2026 false, likelihood \"impossible\". Rationale: person not a basketball player.\n\n1284: Marlene L Rothe, Dow Europe. Not known but plausible. Could be an executive. Likelihood medium.\n\n1285: Bernhard Eisel, professional cyclist, former Ineos Grenadiers rider (formerly Team Sky). He retired from pro cycling in 2019. Could be staff? The description says member of Ineos Grenadiers organization (team). He could be a staff member; leaving in 2026 plausible. Likelihood low-medium.\n\n1286: Matthias Winner leaving Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz (Florence). Not known but plausible academic. Likelihood medium.\n\n1287: Ed Smith, basketball player, New York Knicks. There is Ed Smith (born 1979) former NBA player, but not Knicks. Could be fictional. Plausible but unlikely. Likelihood low.\n\n1288: Tomáš Votava leaving Skála ÍF (Icelandic football club). Not known but plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1289: Sheila Mukerjee joining Darlington F.C. (English football club). Not known but plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1290: Frank Beaton joining German Research Foundation (DFG) as member. DFG membership is for institutions, not individuals. Could be a member of the board? Might be unrealistic phrasing but plausible as a researcher receiving membership. Likelihood low-medium.\n\n1291: Tim Murphy leaving Colorado State Rams men's basketball. Tim Murphy is a known football coach at Harvard, not basketball. So improbable. Likely impossible.\n\n1292: Kareem Carpenter leaving Eastern Michigan Eagles men's basketball. Not known. Could be plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n1293: Masataka Ohtani leaving Riken. Not known but plausible Japanese researcher. Likelihood medium.\n\n1294: Matthias Egger leaving Aarhus University. There is a researcher Matthias Egger (epidemiologist) at University of Zurich, not Aarhus. Could be plausible that he leaves. Likelihood medium.\n\n1295: Muhammad Shafiq Jamal leaving Kedah Darul Aman F.C. (Malaysian football club). Not known but plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1296: María Alejandra González-González leaving University of Texas at Dallas. Plausible academic. Likelihood medium.\n\n1297: Anthony Lagardère leaving US Dax (French rugby club). Anthony Lagardère is a French businessman (Lagardère Group) not a rugby player. So impossible.\n\n128? Wait 1298: David Dahlke began tenure at German Research Foundation. Could be plausible as staff. Likelihood medium.\n\n1299: Aled de Malmanche leaving Waikato Rugby Union. Aled de Malmanche is a New Zealand rugby league player, not union. Could be plausible if switched codes, but leaving union? He played rugby league, not union. So unlikely but not impossible if he was in union. Likelihood low.\n\n1300: Kurt M Lin leaving National Yang-Ming University. Not known but plausible.

J. Van Hooft. I am not aware of such person. Could be a professor? Search memory: There is a \"Edwin van Hooft\" maybe a researcher? Not sure. Erasmus University Rotterdam staff includes many. Could be plausible that a staff member ends tenure June 1 2026. No impossibility. Likelihood: medium? Since plausible but unknown. I'd set possible true, likelihood low to medium. I'd choose \"low\" because no evidence but possible.\n\n1382: Nishinojiri replacing Fukumitsu, Toyama. These sound like Japanese place names? \"Nishinojiri\" maybe a person? \"Fukumitsu, Toyama\" is a location (Fukumitsu is a town in Toyama prefecture). The phrasing \"replacing Fukumitsu, Toyama\" seems odd: replacing a place? Likely nonsense. So impossible. possible_in_2026 false, likelihood impossible.\n\n1383: Lisa Mize ending membership with Puerto Rico women's national softball team. Lisa Mize? I recall a softball player named \"Lisa Mize\"? Not sure. Could be plausible. Likelihood medium. possible true.\n\n1384: Patrick Rockenfeller parting ways with University of Kent. Not known figure. Could be staff. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n1385: Konstantinos Drampis parts ways with Makedonikos F.C. Konstantinos Drampis maybe a Greek footballer? Makedonikos FC is a Greek club. Could be plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1386: Ken Lacey no longer member of Rider Broncs men's basketball team. Ken Lacey? Not known. Could be a player. Rider University team. plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n1387: description missing entity: \"On June 1st, 2026, a significant change occurred as  ceased to be a member of Kronon Grodno\". Missing name. This is impossible to assess because no entity. Likely impossible because unspecified. So possible false.\n\n1388: Ryan VandenBussche joined FC Tyumen. Ryan VandenBussche is a former NHL hockey player, retired. Joining a Russian football club is unlikely (different sport). So impossible. possible false.\n\n1389: Artyom Popov tenure with FC Kazanka Moscow ended. Artyom Popov is a Russian footballer, currently with FC Kazanka? He is a midfielder for FC Kazanka (reserve of Lokomotiv). Could be plausible he leaves. Likelihood medium.\n\n1390: Simon Labouyrie no longer member of Union Sportive Bressane. He is a French rugby player? Actually Simon Labouyrie is a rugby union player for US Bressane. Leaving plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1391: Craig Gillies joined FC SOYUZ-Gazprom Izhevsk. Craig Gillies is a former Welsh rugby player, not football. Joining Russian football club improbable. So impossible.\n\n1392: Phil Younghusband part ways with Mendiola F.C. 1991. Phil Younghusband is a Filipino footballer, retired, played for Mendiola? He played for Mendiola in 2022? He retired 2022. By 2026, could have left earlier. So plausible.

Most are plausible: players leaving college teams, staff changes, etc. Some may be impossible due to unrealistic names or organizations (e.g., The Clash is a band that disbanded decades ago; adding a new member in 2026 is impossible). Also \"Dangerous Darkies\" maybe a fictional team? Could be a fictional club; but plausibility? Might be a non-existent team. Also \"Kaspars Gorkšs\" is a retired Latvian footballer; joining a team called Dangerous Darkies (unknown) maybe improbable but not impossible. However \"The Clash\" original members died; adding new member is impossible because the band is defunct; but could be a reunion? The Clash still exists as a brand? Likely impossible.\n\nAlso \"MKE Ankaragücü\" is a Turkish football club; Stephan Pollmann? Not known but plausible.\n\n\"International Monetary Fund\" employee leaving is plausible.\n\n\"Regione Siciliana\" (Sicily region) employee leaving plausible.\n\n\"German Research Foundation\" appointment plausible.\n\n\"Israel– Premier Tech\" is a cycling team; Guy Gabay? plausible.\n\n\"ASJ Soyaux-Charente\" is a women's football club in France; Warren Lipka? plausible.\n\n\"Macclesfield Town F.C.\" currently defunct (entered administration 2020, reformed as Macclesfield FC). In 2023, Macclesfield Town was wound up. So joining Macclesfield Town F.C. in 2026 is impossible unless reformed.

So impossible. Likelihood \"impossible\", possible_in_2026 false.\n\n- Macclesfield Town F.C.: The club was wound up; but a phoenix club \"Macclesfield FC\" exists. The name \"Macclesfield Town F.C.\" is defunct. So joining that exact entity is impossible. So impossible.\n\n- Dangerous Darkies: Not a known professional team; could be a fictional or defunct. Likely impossible. But could be a local amateur team? The description says \"Dangerous Darkies\". Without evidence, treat as implausible but not impossible? The instruction: if absolutely impossible, false; otherwise true. It's not absolutely impossible for a team with that name to exist. So possible true, but low likelihood.\n\n- Kaspars Gorkšs is retired; could join a team as player? He retired, but could be in management. Still plausible.\n\nThus only two impossible.\n\nAll others plausible.\n\nNow assign likelihood categories:\n\n- High: typical staff/player leaving a team on a given date.

Kipp leaving Vanderbilt University Medical Center June 1 2026. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n1427: Demetri Goodson no longer member of Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team June 1 2026. Goodson is former NFL player, not basketball. Unlikely. Likelihood low.\n\n1428: Marcos Nunes starting at Diyarbakırspor June 1 2026. Marcos Nunes is a Brazilian footballer, plausible.

Need to assess each description for plausibility.\n\nWe need to consider factual accuracy: are the people real? Many names may be obscure or possibly fictional. If a person is not known to exist, we treat as possibly fictional, but scenario could still be plausible (someone could exist). However we need to evaluate based on general plausibility. If the person is a known real person with known status that contradicts scenario, then impossible. If unknown, plausible.\n\nLet's quickly check known names:\n\n- Kamran Sadiq: Not sure. Could be a staff at BC Children's Hospital. Plausible.\n\n- Bert Theunissen: Not known; could be a footballer? Heracles Almelo is a Dutch football club. Could be plausible.\n\n- Battista Tresoldi: Not known; U.S. Grosseto 1912 is an Italian football club. Plausible.\n\n- Ann Archbold: Could be a researcher; German Research Foundation (DFG) membership is for institutions, not individuals. DFG members are institutions, not people. So \"joined as a member\" is inaccurate. Likelihood low.\n\n- Aidis Kruopis: Known as a Lithuanian cyclist, not associated with An Post–Chain Reaction (which is a cycling team). He retired. By 2026, could be leaving? He already retired; but being a member of a team now is unlikely. Likelihood low.\n\n- Joe Maurer: Not known; Cornell Big Red men's basketball team. Could be a player; plausible.\n\n- Kémoko Camara: Known as a Guinean football goalkeeper, but K.R.C. Zuid-West-Vlaanderen is a Belgian club (maybe defunct). Plausible but unlikely.\n\n- Ryan M Stauffer: Not known; leaving Penn State. Plausible.\n\n- Gene Start: Not known; Washington State Cougars men's basketball. Plausible.\n\n- Ryuichi Dogaki: Not known; Cerezo Osaka is Japanese football club. Plausible.\n\n- Aleksandar Gojković: Could be a Serbian footballer; FK Borac Čačak is Serbian club. Plausible.\n\n- Dan Balko: Not known; Blues Super Rugby team (New Zealand). Plausible.\n\n- Yelko Gómez: Not known; Caja Rural–Seguros RGA is a cycling team. Plausible.\n\n- Keshad Johnson: Not known; San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball. Plausible.\n\n- Dani Salas: Could be a basketball player; NCAA Division I. Plausible.\n\n- John Tambouras: Not known; German Research Foundation membership unrealistic as before. Likelihood low.\n\n- Corrien Van Haastert: Same issue.\n\n- Raymond J. Carroll: Could be a statistician; joining Bowling Green Falcons men's basketball as staff. Possible (coach). Plausible.\n\n- Marvin Sordell: Former English footballer, retired. Joining Atlético Madrid as player in 2026 unlikely (age). Could be staff? But description says member (player). Likelihood low.\n\n- Ian Lawson (born 1939): Would be 87 in 2026, leaving a research centre? Could be emeritus; plausible departure (retirement). Likelihood medium.\n\nWe also need to set possible_in_2026 false only if absolutely impossible. Many are plausible. For DFG membership, it's impossible for an individual to be a \"member\". So possible_in_2026 = false, likelihood impossible.\n\nSimilarly for Marvin Sordell playing for Atlético Madrid at age ~38? He was born 1987, would be 39 in 2026. Could be a staff, but as player unlikely. So maybe low but not impossible. Could be a coaching role, but description says \"joined Atlético Madrid, marking the beginning of his membership\". Could be as a player? ambiguous. We'll treat as low plausibility but possible.\n\nAidis Kruopis: He retired in 2020. Could rejoin as staff? But description says \"no longer a member\". Could be plausible that he was a member earlier. So plausible.\n\nNow produce results in order, id as string.\n\nWe need likelihood categories: impossible, low, medium, high.\n\nAssign:\n\n1481: plausible, high likelihood (employee leaving). Likelihood high.\n\n1482: plausible, medium (player leaving). Likelihood medium.\n\n1483: plausible, medium.\n\n1484: impossible (DFG individual membership). possible_in_2026 false, likelihood impossible.\n\n1485: plausible, medium (cyclist leaving team). Likelihood medium.\n\n1486: plausible, medium.\n\n1487: plausible, low? Kémoko Camara age? He born 1995, would be 31, could leave. Likelihood medium.\n\n1488: plausible, medium.\n\n1489: plausible, medium.\n\n1490: plausible, medium.\n\n1491: plausible, medium.\n\n1492: plausible, medium.\n\n1493: plausible, medium.\n\n1494: plausible, medium.\n\n1495: plausible, medium.\n\n1496: impossible (DFG). false, impossible.\n\n1497: impossible (DFG). false, impossible.\n\n1498: plausible, medium (staff join).

Likelihood medium.\n\n1568: Niko Bungert - real former German footballer, retired. Nkumba University is in Uganda. Unlikely a retired footballer to be member of a university (maybe staff). Could be plausible as staff. Likelihood low to medium. Probably low.\n\n1569: Massimo Ficcadenti - real football manager, currently managing? He was manager of various clubs. Furman Paladins men's basketball team is US college. He is Italian football manager, unlikely to coach US college basketball. So impossible? Could he be a member (maybe as a consultant)? Very unlikely, but not impossible? He could be hired as a coach? Unlikely due to sport mismatch. I'd say low but not impossible. However \"tenure with the Furman Paladins men's basketball team\" seems implausible. I'd set possible true, likelihood low.\n\n1570: Simone Macrì - unknown; Kickers Offenbach is German football club.

So claim that Dennis Westcott is a member in 2026 is impossible because he's dead. So possible_in_2026 false.\n\nManuel Mosquera born 1984 is a footballer; but \"Ames Research Center\" is NASA; a footballer being a member of a research center is unlikely but not impossible (could be a staff).

Need to assess each description for plausibility by 2026.\n\nWe must consider factual accuracy: are the people real? Some may be obscure. If person likely doesn't exist, scenario may be impossible? But we can treat as plausible if could be a real person. However many names may be fictional. The instruction: \"Base the judgment on general plausibility by 2026 (not certainty).\" So if it's plausible that a person could leave or join a team, even if the person is not known, it's plausible. However if the organization doesn't exist (e.g., \"Dauner– Akkon\" is a German ice hockey team, exists). \"New Zealand Knights FC\" existed but folded 2007; but could be revived? Might be improbable. \"Centenary Gentlemen\" is Centenary College of Louisiana (now defunct?). Actually Centenary College of Louisiana still exists, team is Gentlemen. So plausible.\n\nWe need to evaluate timeline: June 6-9 2026 are Saturdays/Sundays? Let's check: 2026-06-06 is Saturday? 2026 is not a leap year. Let's compute: 2026-01-01 is Thursday (since 2025-01-01 was Wednesday? Actually 2024 is leap year, 2024-01-01 Monday. 2025-01-01 Wednesday (since 2024 had 366 days, shift 2). 2026-01-01 Friday (shift 1). So Jan 1 2026 Friday. Days to June 6: Jan (31), Feb (28) => 59, Mar 31 => 90, Apr 30 => 120, May 31 =>151, June 6 => 157 days. 157 mod 7 = 3 (since 154 is multiple of 7). Starting Friday + 156 days = Thursday? Let's compute: Jan1 Fri. Add 1 day => Sat Jan2. After 157 days, day = Fri + 156 days (since day 0 is Jan1). 156 mod7 = 2, so Fri +2 = Sunday. Wait check: Actually Jan1 is day 1. So Jan1 Fri. Jan2 Sat (2), Jan3 Sun (3), Jan4 Mon (4), Jan5 Tue (5), Jan6 Wed (6), Jan7 Thu (7). So day 7 is Thu. So day 8 Fri, etc. Simpler: Use known calendar: 2026-06-06 is Saturday? Let's quickly check using known: 2025-12-31 Wednesday (since 2025 not leap). 2026-01-01 Thursday? Wait earlier we said Friday. Let's verify: 2024-01-01 Monday (true). 2024 leap adds 2 days, so 2025-01-01 Wednesday. 2025 not leap adds 1 day, so 2026-01-01 Thursday. Yes 2026-01-01 Thursday. Then 2026-06-06: compute day of week: Jan 1 Thu. Days to June 6: Jan (31) -> Feb 1 is Sunday? Let's add 31 days: 31 mod7 =3, Thu+31 days = Sun (since Thu+3 = Sun). So Feb 1 is Sunday. Feb 28 days -> 28 mod7=0, so Mar 1 also Sunday. Mar 31 -> 31 mod7=3, so Apr 1 = Wed. Apr 30 -> 30 mod7=2, so May 1 = Fri. May 31 -> 31 mod7=3, so Jun 1 = Mon. Then June 6 = Saturday (Mon +5 days). Yes June 6 2026 is Saturday. Good. So dates align with day names.\n\nThus timeline feasible.\n\nNow evaluate each item:\n\n1661: Jacob Lampkin, Pacific Tigers men's basketball team (University of the Pacific). Is there a player named Jacob Lampkin? Not known. Could be plausible that a player leaves. Likelihood: low? It's plausible but unknown. I'd say possible_in_2026 = true, likelihood low (since unknown). Rationale: No public record, but players regularly leave.\n\n1662: Lars Bernard at Joint Research Centre (European Commission). Could be plausible. Likelihood medium? It's plausible for staff to leave. So possible true, likelihood medium.\n\n1663: Dick Holmes, Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team. Not known. Could be plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n1664: Antonio Burks, born 1980, Memphis Tigers men's basketball team. Antonio Burks is a former pro player, born 1980, but he never played for Memphis Tigers (college). Could be improbable that at age 46 he is still on college team. So impossible? He would be 46 in 2026, unlikely to be a college player. So possible_in_2026 false, likelihood impossible. Rationale: Age makes it unrealistic.\n\n1665: Jan-Marc Temmen, Dauner–Akkon (German ice hockey). Could be plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n1666: Paulo Vieira Da Cunha joins Bury F.C. Bury FC was expelled from English league in 2019, reformed as Bury AFC. In 2026 maybe Bury FC still not in league. Joining plausible if club exists. Likelihood low-medium. I'd say possible true, likelihood low.\n\n1667: Zohaib Khan joins PFC CSKA Moscow (football). Could be plausible, but CSKA Moscow is top club, signing unknown player maybe low but possible. Likelihood low.\n\n1668: Rahul Srivastava parts ways with La Trobe University (Australia). Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1669: Sidharth Arya starts working for Basáñez (Uruguayan football club). Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n1670: Dustin Wells no longer member of New Zealand Knights FC. The club folded 2007; unless revived, improbable. Likelihood impossible. So possible false.\n\n1671: Mackie Smith leaves Memphis Tigers men's basketball team. Age unknown. Could be plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n1672: Sarah H. Bastin leaves University of Canterbury. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1673: Terryl Woolery set to end his stint in NCAA Division I Men's Basketball on 2026-06-08. Could be a player or coach. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n1674: Shaun Belbey leaves Syracuse Orange men's basketball team. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n1675: Mercedes M Okumura leaves Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1676: Sophie Stonor and James Stourton divorce. Both are British aristocracy? Sophie Stonor (Lady Stonor) maybe real. Divorce plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1677: Meriem Hasmim leaves Institut Gustave Roussy (cancer institute). Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1678: Luka Vulikic joins Carabobo F.C. (Venezuelan football). Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n1679: Reggie Cooksey leaves Centenary Gentlemen basketball team. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n1680: Andreas Johansson (born 1982) starts working for Fenerbahçe S.K. He is a Swedish footballer, retired. At age 44, could be staff (coach). \"started working\" plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\nNow produce JSON with id as string.

Provide JSON with results array in same order. For each, we need id as string, possible_in_2026 boolean, likelihood (impossible, low, medium, high), rationale (<=2 sentences). Need to assess factual accuracy: are the people real? Many names may be obscure or possibly fictional. If person is real but timeline unrealistic (e.g., Robert Iarusci, former player, would be old). He was born 1956, would be 70 in 2026, but being a member of New York Cosmos (team defunct) from 1970-1985, but \"no longer a member as of 2026\" is plausible (he's not a member). But the description says he was part of from 1970 to 1985, ending 2026 - that suggests he remained member until 2026, which is unrealistic because team dissolved. So likely impossible.\n\nWe need to decide plausible vs impossible. The rule: If scenario is absolutely impossible in 2026, possible_in_2026 = false, otherwise true. So many are plausible (people can join/leave clubs). Even if the person is fictional, we treat as plausible? The instruction: \"Base the judgment on general plausibility by 2026 (not certainty).\" So if the scenario is not impossible (e.g., a person could join a club), we mark true. Even if the person is unknown, we assume plausible.\n\nBut need to consider factual accuracy: Are the people, organizations, relationships realistic? If unrealistic (e.g., a 70-year-old cyclist joining German Research Foundation as member - plausible as a member maybe). Might be low likelihood but not impossible.\n\nThus likely most are possible with low to medium likelihood. Only some impossible: e.g., Robert Iarusci being a member of New York Cosmos until 2026 (team defunct). Also John McGovern (born 1949) parting ways with Palermo F.C. in 2026 - he would be 77, unlikely to be player but could be staff? The description says \"renowned footballer\" set to part ways as of 2026, but likely not plausible as active player. But could be as ambassador? Might be low but not impossible.\n\nWe need to assign likelihood categories: impossible, low, medium, high. Use plausible assessment.\n\nLet's go through each:\n\n1701: Pavel Dorokhin - unknown. FC Taganrog is a Russian lower league club. Player leaving in 2026 plausible. Likelihood high (common). possible true.\n\n1702: Robert Iarusci - former player, New York Cosmos existed 1970-85. He was a player then. Being a \"member\" until 2026 unrealistic. So impossible. possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n1703: Pablo Diogo joining Sv Wittlich (maybe German club). Plausible. Likelihood medium-high.\n\n1704: John McGovern (born 1949) parting ways with Palermo F.C. as of 2026. He would be 77, unlikely to be player; could be coach? But description says \"renowned footballer\". Likely impossible as player. But could be staff? The description says \"membership\". I'd mark low likelihood but not impossible? Might be improbable but not impossible if he's in some honorary role. I'd set possible true, likelihood low.\n\n1705: Isabel Moskowich started working for Bolton Wanderers F.C. on June 13, 2026. Could be staff. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1706: Koji Arimura leaving Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). Real lab. Person could be researcher. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1707: José Gonçalves, a cyclist, joining German Research Foundation as member. The DFG is a funding organization; membership maybe as a panel member. Plausible but unusual. Likelihood low.\n\n1708: Agus Medina leaving CE Sabadell FC B. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1709: Lukáš Zich leaving FC Slovan Liberec. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1710: Brian Lewis started working for ESA Brive (maybe a club). ESA Brive is a French rugby club. Could be staff. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1711: Cameron Sadler leaving Sam Houston Bearkats men's basketball team. Could be player or staff. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1712: Hosung Bae leaving Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1713: Visitacao Lobo leaving Sesa Football Academy. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1714: Unnamed new member to Real Academia Alfonso X el Sabio. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1715: Mike Seerey joining Club Atlético Alvarado. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1716: Matti Reinikainen leaving University of Eastern Finland. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1717: Maria Kislikova ending tenure at University College London. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1718: Jackie Sheehan's collegiate basketball career ending; she will no longer be playing in NCAA Division I Men's Basketball. Note: Jackie Sheehan is a female name, but NCAA Division I Men's Basketball is male. So impossible (gender mismatch). So impossible.\n\n1719: Julian D Hunt leaving Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1720: Mohammad Marufuzzaman leaving Universiti Tenaga Nasional. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\nNow produce JSON with id as string (so \"1701\").\n\nRationale: concise <=2 sentences.\n\nLet's craft.\n\nFor each, assign likelihood:\n\n- High: common scenario, no issues. Use \"high\".\n- Medium: plausible but some minor oddities.\n- Low: unusual but possible.\n- Impossible: impossible.\n\nThus:\n\n1701: high.\n1702: impossible.\n1703: medium?

Not known; Pasteur Institute is real. Could depart. plausible.\n\nNoddy Holder leaving Slade: plausible but low likelihood (since band not active).

Not impossible.\n\nPaul Codrea (born 1977) would be 49 in 2026. He retired long ago; being a member of Siena 1904 (football club) as player unlikely, but could be staff.

Provide JSON with results array in same order. For each, determine possible_in_2026 (true if not impossible) and likelihood (impossible, low, medium, high). Provide concise rationale <=2 sentences.\n\nWe need to assess factual accuracy: Are the people real? Some may be fictional. If person is historical (e.g., Amet-khan Sultan is a WWII Soviet ace, died 1944). So cannot start working in 2026. That is impossible. Similarly, Henryk Sass from 1967-68 likely deceased. Rolf M. Zinkernagel is a Nobel laureate immunologist, unlikely to join Legia Warsaw II soccer team. So impossible.\n\nWe need to know each person: Some may be obscure or fictional. If unknown, we assume plausible unless contradictory (e.g., age). For athletes, need to consider age. For example, \"Choppy Patterson\" unknown; could be a college player, plausible. \"Wes Wilkin\" maybe a real basketball player? Not sure. But plausible.\n\nWe must consider organizations: Aston University hiring someone; plausible. German Research Foundation (DFG) hiring; plausible. DB Class 111 trains manufacturing by KraussMaffei: KraussMaffei is a German engineering firm, but they historically produce injection molding, not trains. DB Class 111 built by Krauss-Maffei? Actually DB Class 111 locomotives built by Krauss-Maffei in 1970s. Manufacturing ceased long ago. So claim that they were manufacturing them up to 2026 is unlikely; they stopped decades ago. So \"no longer being manufactured as of June 20, 2026\" could be plausible if they were still being made, but they aren't. So scenario that they were manufacturing until 2026 is implausible; but the statement is that they stopped manufacturing, implying they were manufacturing up to that date. Since they never were, the premise is false, making scenario impossible. So likely impossible.\n\nSimilarly, \"Paris FC\" a French football club; \"Raymond Frey\" unknown; plausible departure.\n\n\"National University of Singapore\" professor Raphaël Liégeois: He is a real researcher (maybe at NUS). He could leave; plausible.\n\n\"Pittsburgh Spirit\" is a defunct indoor soccer team (MISL) revived? Actually Pittsburgh Spirit existed 1978-1990. Not active now. So joining in 2026 improbable unless revived. So likely impossible.\n\n\"Yale School of Public Health\" Geoffrey Attardo: unknown; plausible.\n\n\"Crucero del Norte\" Argentine football club; Fabricio Lenci is a real Argentine footballer born 1984, would be 42 in 2026, could still be player? Unlikely but could be staff. Leaving club plausible.\n\n\"Craig S. T. Daughtry\" at Purdue University; plausible.\n\n\"Max Planck Institute For The Structure And Dynamics Of Matter\" (Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter) exists; Luigi Malavolti unknown; plausible.\n\n\"Stellenbosch University\" Arpan Hazra unknown; plausible.\n\n\"Jeju National University\" Jesu Arockiaraj unknown; plausible.\n\n\"FC Minsk\" football club; Graham Dugoni unknown; plausible.\n\n\"German Research Foundation\" (DFG) Slavčo Georgievski unknown; plausible.\n\n\"University of St Andrews\" Rab Wilson unknown; plausible.\n\n\"Legia Warsaw II\" is reserve team; Rolf M. Zinkernagel is a Nobel laureate born 1940, would be 86 in 2026; joining a football team impossible. So impossible.\n\n\"Swinburne University of Technology\" Guosong Lai unknown; plausible.\n\n\"Chicago Mustangs\" soccer team existed 1967-68; Henryk Sass presumably from that era, would be >80; but statement says he was member 1967-68 and now no longer member in 2026. Since team likely defunct, but could be revived. However being member from 1967-68 suggests he is old; but \"no longer a member\" is trivial; but plausible? The team existed historically; if still exists, he could be honorary? But likely impossible because team no longer exists. So likely impossible.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nWe need fields: id as string (convert number to string). possible_in_2026 boolean. likelihood string.\n\nWe'll assign likelihood: For plausible but uncertain, maybe \"low\" or \"medium\". Use \"low\" for simple staff changes. \"medium\" for more uncertain but possible. \"high\" for very likely (e.g., typical staff turnover). Provide rationale.\n\nLet's go through each id:\n\n1801: Amet-khan Sultan died 1944, cannot start job. impossible. possible_in_2026 false, likelihood \"impossible\". Rationale: Amet‑Khan Sultan died in 1944, so cannot be employed in 2026.\n\n1802: DB Class 111 trains no longer manufactured by KraussMaffei as of June 20 2026. Since KraussMaffei stopped building locomotives decades ago, the premise that they were manufacturing until 2026 is false, making scenario impossible. So false. possible false, likelihood \"impossible\". Rationale: Krauss‑Maffei ceased locomotive production long before 2026, so they could not stop manufacturing that year.\n\n1803: Choppy Patterson no longer member of Clemson Tigers men's basketball team as of June 20 2026. Assuming Choppy Patterson is a college player, roster changes are normal; plausible. Likelihood high. possible true. Rationale: College basketball rosters regularly change; a player leaving in 2026 is plausible.\n\n1804: Dorota Fopp‑Bayat began tenure at German Research Foundation June 20 2026. Plausible; hiring academics. Likelihood high.\n\n1805: Wes Wilkin no longer member of Eastern Illinois Panthers men's basketball team June 20 2026. Plausible; roster turnover. Likelihood high.\n\n1806: Raymond Frey no longer member of Paris FC June 20 2026. Plausible; football transfers. Likelihood medium (depends on age unknown). We'll set medium.\n\n1807: Raphaël Liégeois leaving NUS June 20 2026. He is a real researcher; plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1808: Wei Wei joined Pittsburgh Spirit June 20 2026. Pittsburgh Spirit defunct; unless revived, unlikely. So impossible. possible false, likelihood \"impossible\". Rationale: Pittsburgh Spirit has not operated since 1990, making a new player in 2026 implausible.\n\n1809: Geoffrey Attardo leaving Yale School of Public Health June 20 2026. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1810: Fabricio Lenci leaves Crucero del Norte June 20 2026. He is a 42‑year‑old footballer; could still be playing or retire; plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1811: Craig S. T. Daughtry leaving Purdue University June 20 2026. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1812: Luigi Malavolti left Max Planck Institute June 21 2026. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1813: Arpan Hazra left Stellenbosch University June 21 2026. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1814: Jesu Arockiaraj ends tenure at Jeju National University June 21 2026. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1815: Graham Dugoni joined FC Minsk June 21 2026. Graham Dugoni is a former US soccer player, born 1989, would be 37; could join as player or staff. Plausible. Likelihood low to medium. We'll set low.\n\n1816: Slavčo Georgievski joined German Research Foundation June 21 2026. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n1817: Rab Wilson left University of St Andrews June 21 2026. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n1818: Rolf M. Zinkernagel joined Legia Warsaw II June 21 2026. He is a Nobel laureate, age 86, unlikely to join football team. Impossible. possible false, likelihood \"impossible\".\n\n1819: Guosong Lai left Swinburne University June 21 2026. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1820: Henryk Sass no longer member of Chicago Mustangs, team from 1967-68, as of June 21 2026. Since team defunct, and membership ended decades ago, statement is trivial but could be true if team revived; but given historical context, unlikely. We'll mark impossible. Rationale: Chicago Mustangs ceased operations in 1968, so a membership ending in 2026 is implausible.\n\nNow produce JSON with id as string.\n\nLet's craft results.\n\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 3013, "prompt_tokens": 1995, "total_tokens": 5008, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null, "kv_transfer_params": null}

He was manager of Aldershot Town 2005-2009. As of 2026, could he be a member? He would be about 60s. Could be plausible that he leaves. No impossibility. Likelihood: medium? It's plausible but uncertain. We'll assign possible_in_2026 true, likelihood medium.\n\n1862: Vincent Peters at Tilburg University. Not known. Could be plausible. Likelihood low? It's plausible. We'll set possible true, likelihood low (since no known person). Rationale: plausible employment termination.\n\n1863: Bill Moon at NASA. Bill Moon? Not known. Could be plausible.

Plausible. possible true, likelihood low.\n\n1867: Bryan Pérez at A.S.D. Femminile Inter Milano (women's soccer?). Bryan male? Could be plausible but gender mismatch maybe improbable. But could be staff. We'll treat plausible. possible true, likelihood low.\n\n1868: Bruno Ferreira has joined Fort Lauderdale Strikers, tenure would last from 2006 to 2016. But statement is reported as of June 30 2026, saying he joined and tenure would last 2006-2016, which is contradictory (past). Also Fort Lauderdale Strikers folded 2016. So impossible scenario: joining a defunct club with past tenure. So possible_in_2026 false, likelihood impossible.\n\n1869: Tommie Smith no longer member of Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team as of June 30 2026. Tommie Smith is a famous Olympic sprinter, not basketball player. Could be a different person with same name. Plausible. possible true, likelihood low.\n\n1870: Massimo Grima at Valletta F.C. He is a Maltese footballer, retired. Could be staff. plausible. possible true, likelihood low.\n\n1871: Patrizio Castagnola at Harvard Medical School. Not known. plausible. possible true, likelihood low.\n\n1872: Jaak Leimann membership with Communist Party of the Soviet Union ends June 30 2026. Soviet Union dissolved 1991, party no longer exists. So impossible. possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n1873: Jonathan Faña no longer member of Puerto Rico Islanders. He is a Dominican footballer, played for Puerto Rico Islanders earlier, retired. Could be plausible that he leaves. possible true, likelihood low.\n\n1874: Johann Eekhoff joins Colgate Raiders men's basketball team. Johann Eekhoff is a German economist, not basketball player, likely too old. Also NCAA eligibility age restrictions; a senior economist joining college team as player improbable. Could be as staff/coach? The description says member, likely player. That seems implausible. So likely impossible. possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n1875: Yong Sung Cha no longer employed at Wonju Severance Christian Hospital.

Plausible. possible true, likelihood low.\n\n1877: Dorival Thomas no longer member of Stade Lavallois. Could be plausible. possible true, likelihood low.\n\n1880: Oliver Bozanic tenure with Yugoslavia national football team ends June 30 2026. Yugoslavia no longer exists; national team dissolved. So impossible. possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n1879: Daniel Jarl will no longer work for Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball team as of June 30 2026. Daniel Jarl is a Swedish footballer, not basketball. Could be staff? Unlikely. But could be a coach? Not known. Likelihood low but plausible? Might be improbable but not impossible. We'll set possible true, likelihood low.\n\n1880 (actually 1880 is Ivy Dobson at FC Luzern). Ivy Dobson? Not known.

Most are generic statements about individuals leaving or joining teams. Since we have no evidence that these individuals exist or are real, but the question is about factual accuracy of people, organizations, relationships. If the person is unknown, we cannot verify; but plausibility: it's possible for a person to join/leave. Unless the organization doesn't exist or the date is impossible (e.g., June 30, 2026 is a Wednesday? Let's check: 2026-06-30 day of week. 2026 is not leap year. Jan 1 2026 is Thursday (since 2025 Jan 1 is Wednesday? Actually 2024 is leap year, 2024 Jan 1 Monday, 2025 Jan 1 Wednesday, 2026 Jan 1 Thursday). Then June 30: days till June 30: Jan31, Feb28, Mar31, Apr30, May31, Jun30 = 31+28+31+30+31+30 = 181 days. 181 mod 7 = 181-7*25=181-175=6. Thursday + 6 days = Wednesday. So June 30, 2026 is Wednesday, not Tuesday. Many descriptions say Tuesday, June 30, 2026. That's a factual inconsistency. So timeline feasibility: date mismatch with day of week. That makes the description factually inaccurate. However the evaluation criteria: \"Factual Accuracy: Are the people, organizations, and relationships mentioned realistic and factually plausible?\" The day-of-week mismatch is a factual error. So likely impossible? But the scenario could still happen; the day-of-week being wrong is a minor error in description, but the event could still occur. The question: we assess plausibility of the event, not the description's correctness. If description contains an impossible claim (e.g., \"Tuesday, June 30, 2026\" which is not Tuesday), does that make the scenario impossible? Probably we consider it low plausibility due to factual error, but not impossible. However the instruction: \"If the scenario is absolutely impossible in 2026, then possible_in_2026 = false, otherwise true.\" The scenario (person leaving team on that date) is possible; the day-of-week error is just a mistake. So possible_in_2026 = true. Likelihood maybe low to medium because unknown individuals. But we need to consider if the organizations exist: Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team exists, Ohio State Buckeyes, etc. Galatasaray S.K. football team exists. Al-Shoulla FC exists (Saudi club). National Chung Hsing University exists. National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology? Not sure; maybe exists in Japan? Could be plausible. German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) exists. Chacarita Juniors (Argentinian club) exists. FC Desna Chernihiv (Ukrainian) exists. TTM Thailand Tobacco Monopoly F.C. exists. Auckland cricket team (Auckland Aces) exists. Korea Institute for Advanced Study exists. Finnish National Theatre exists. England national rugby union team exists. International Atomic Energy Agency exists. Fredrikstad FK (Norwegian club) exists. NCAA Division I Men's Basketball league exists. San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball team exists.\n\nThus all plausible.\n\nThus all items possible_in_2026 = true. Likelihood: Since we have no evidence of these individuals, but it's plausible for any person to join/leave, assign \"low\" maybe. Some may be more plausible like a known athlete? But we don't know.

Determine if possible_in_2026 true unless impossible. Likelihood categories: impossible, low, medium, high. Provide rationale <=2 sentences.\n\nWe need to assess factual accuracy: are the people, organizations realistic? Many names seem obscure, possibly fictional. But the question: \"general plausibility by 2026 (not certainty)\". If names are unknown, could be real but not known. Since not impossible, we can consider plausible. However some may be impossible due to dates: June 30, 2026 is a Wednesday? Let's check calendar: 2026 is not a leap year. June 30, 2026 day of week? Let's compute: Jan 1 2026 is Thursday (since 2025 Jan 1 is Wednesday? Actually 2024 is leap year, 2024 Jan 1 Monday, 2025 Jan 1 Wednesday, 2026 Jan 1 Thursday). Then days to June 30: Jan 31 days, Feb 28, Mar 31, Apr 30, May 31, Jun 30 => total days before June 30 = 31+28+31+30+31+29 = 180? Wait June 30 is the 181st day of year (non-leap). Starting Thursday Jan1, add 180 days => 180 mod 7 = 5 days. Thursday +5 = Tuesday? Let's compute: Thu (0), Fri1, Sat2, Sun3, Mon4, Tue5. So June 30, 2026 is Tuesday. Many descriptions say Tuesday, correct. Some say Wednesday July 1, 2026: July 1 would be Wednesday (since next day). So day-of-week matches.\n\nThus timeline feasible.\n\nWe need to judge plausibility of each scenario: employment changes, sports team membership, university affiliation. Generally plausible.\n\nBut some may be impossible: e.g., \"Bill Librera's tenure in the Ncaa Division I Men's Basketball came to a close on Tuesday, June 30th, 2026\" - NCAA Division I is for college players; Bill Librera may be older? Not known. Could be plausible.\n\n\"St. Louis Cardinals\" is baseball, but Dorota Juszczyk set to start working for them - could be staff, plausible.\n\n\"German Research Foundation\" (DFG) membership? Could be a researcher.\n\nThus all plausible.\n\nLikelihood: maybe assign high for typical straightforward employment changes, medium for less certain (e.g., unknown person in high-profile organization), low for obscure improbable? But guidelines: \"If scenario is absolutely impossible, possible_in_2026 = false, otherwise true.\" Likelihood categories reflect chance: impossible, low, medium, high. We can assign high for typical plausible events, medium for less certain but still plausible, low for unlikely but not impossible.\n\nGiven many unknown names, but could be real.

Leon Thomas is a former Iowa Hawkeyes player (born 1993). By 2026 he would be 33, likely not a player; could be a staff? The description says member of team, implying player. Unlikely a 33-year-old player. Could be a graduate assistant? But phrase \"member of the team\" suggests player. So scenario of him leaving the team is plausible (he could have been on roster earlier and left). But by 2026 he would already be out. So statement could be true (he is no longer a member). That's plausible. Likelihood high that it's true (since he would have left). So possible_in_2026 = true, likelihood high. Rationale: Leon Thomas would be well past playing age, so his departure by 2026 is expected.\n\n1982: Mary O' Malley (note space) part ways with University of Northampton effective July 1 2026. Not sure if such person exists. Could be a staff. Plausible that any staff leaves. No impossibility. Likelihood medium (unknown). possible true.\n\n1983: Arsène Wenger's tenure with FC Krasnodar ended July 1 2026. Wenger born 1949, would be 77 in 2026. He retired from coaching long ago. Unlikely to be coaching Krasnodar. So scenario impossible (he is not likely to be manager). So possible_in_2026 false, likelihood impossible.\n\n1984: Frank van Kappen no longer a member of AS Pierrots Vauban Strasbourg as of July 1 2026. Not sure who he is. Could be a player. Age unknown. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1985: Patrick Samuel left Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) July 1 2026. Could be a staff or player. Plausible.

United July 1 2026. Shawn Medved is a former US soccer player born 1967, retired. By 2026 he would be 59, not a player. Could be staff but description says member of team. Unlikely. So impossible? Could be a coach? But not known. Likelihood low? I'd say impossible for him to be a player; but could be staff. Since description ambiguous, but \"member of D.C. United\" could be any role. It's plausible he could be in front office. So possible true, likelihood low to medium. I'd choose low.\n\n1988: Ko Van Dijk Jr. joined University of Colorado Denver July 1 2026. Could be faculty. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1989: Bénédicte Kuntziger leaving biology dept at Ernst-Moritz-Arndt Universität Greifswald July 1 2026. Plausible.

Could be player; unknown. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1992: Matteo Carrara left Cycle Collstrop July 1 2026. Cycle Collstrop is a cycling team? Could be rider. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1993: Félix Dja Ettien left UD Alzira July 1 2026. He is a former Ivorian footballer born 1974, would be 52. Not a player. Could be staff. Unlikely. Likelihood low.\n\n1994: Valerio Sbragaglia left Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries July 1 2026. Could be researcher. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1995: Seyed A. Ghorashi left University of Melbourne July 1 2026. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1996: Darren Sawyer leaving Johns Hopkins University July 1 2026. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n1997: Dennis Krohne left Harkemase Boys July 1 2026. Harkemase Boys is a Dutch amateur football club. Could be player. Plausible.

Likelihood medium.\n\n1999: Merlin Olsen no longer a member of Los Angeles Rams July 1 2026. Merlin Olsen (1939-2010) is deceased. So impossible. possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n2000: Christophe Vanderaa joined FC Kuzbass Kemerovo July 1 2026. Not sure if person exists. Could be plausible.

Some names may be real (Hyun-jin Ryu is a real MLB pitcher, but he is with Dodgers? Actually Hyun-jin Ryu is a pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers as of 2024, but he is older (born 1987). Could he leave in 2026? Possibly, but plausible. However scenario says he leaves on July 1 2026. That's plausible. So possible_in_2026 = true, likelihood maybe medium? Since retirement age ~39, plausible.\n\nOther names: Dick O' Neal? Not known. Could be fictional. Could join Wrexham A.F.C. (owned by Ryan Reynolds). Plausible. So true.\n\nTytti Heinonen? Not known. Dhofar Club (Omani football club). Could be plausible.\n\nWanda Lopes? Not known. Hanshin Tigers (Japanese baseball). plausible.\n\nEli Guttman? Not known.

Likelihood categories: \"low\", \"medium\", \"high\". Need to assign based on plausibility. Most are plausible but uncertain due to unknown individuals. Could assign \"low\" for obscure fictional persons? But scenario plausible.

Lee, Brenton Hughes, Nicole Baumgarth, David Smith, Ilias Solakis, Johnny Simm, Brian Raimondi, Cho Sung-hwan (born 1982).

Could be a lower league player. Plausible.\n\nFC Kuban Krasnodar - club was dissolved? Actually FC Kuban (Kuban Krasnodar) existed but was dissolved in 2018. There is a revived club? There is FC Kuban-2? So a tenure ending July 1 2026 could be plausible if club exists. But historically, FC Kuban was dissolved; a new club FC Kuban (2020) maybe. Might be questionable but not impossible.\n\nCS Hammam-Lif is a Tunisian club. Eric Asamoah-Frimpong - unknown. Could be plausible.\n\nJim Ard - Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball team. Jim Ard is a former NBA player born 1955, would be 71 in 2026, not a player. Could be a staff? But description says \"member of the team\". Unlikely.

Likelihood medium.\n\n2108: Ishwar Radhakrishnan leaving Scripps Research. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n2109: Benny Malone leaving Washington Commanders. Could be a player; there is a former NFL player named Benny Malone (born 1953) died 2020. Actually Benny Malone (NFL) died 2020, so cannot be member in 2026. If it's that person, impossible. But could be another person with same name. Since we cannot verify, but given known person is deceased, scenario of him being member in 2026 is impossible. However description says \"no longer a member as of July 8, 2026\". If he is dead, he can't be member; but could be a different person. Hard. I'd assign low plausibility but not impossible. Likelihood low.\n\n21010 (id 2110): Maria Grazia Cerrito leaving Uniformed Services University. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n2111: Union of Journalists in Finland sever ties with International Federation of Journalists. Plausible organizational decision.

Could join as staff or ambassador, but description says \"member\". Could be improbable but not impossible. Likelihood low.\n\n2117: Mike Malone no longer member of Loyola Greyhounds men's basketball team. Mike Malone is a basketball coach, not a player; could be staff. Likelihood medium.\n\n2118: Brian I.

The question: \"general plausibility by 2026 (not certainty)\". So unless clearly impossible (e.g., someone dead, or organization not existing), we mark possible true. Likelihood: assess how likely such event (joining or leaving) is. Since many are random, we can assign low to medium. For impossible: e.g., Nobby Stiles (the famous English footballer) died 2020, so cannot be member in 2026. So impossible. Also maybe \"José Serrano born 1981\" still alive, plausible. \"Rebecca Silbermann\" unknown but plausible. \"Murray Hofmeyr\" unknown. \"Neos Aionas Trikomou\" is a club; parting ways with Cyprus Football Association? Could be plausible. \"Roberto Lerici\" joining German Research Foundation as member? Could be plausible. \"Hideaki Yano\" at Addiction Research Center plausible. \"D.

Also \"Nobby Stiles\" is a famous English footballer who died 2020, so impossible.\n\nCheck any other impossible: \"Rebecca Silbermann\" unknown but plausible. \"Marius E Yamakou\" unknown but plausible. \"D. Jean Burnell\" could be a female? Texas Longhorns men's basketball team only male players; but could be a coach or staff. Could be plausible. \"Kerry Haggard\" could be male/female; plausible.\n\nThus only impossible: id 2180 (Nobby Stiles). All others possible true.\n\nLikelihood: Since these are routine staff changes, likely low to medium. For high likelihood maybe typical for players joining clubs? Could be medium. We'll assign \"low\" for most, \"medium\" for some plausible high-profile changes? But we need to choose categories.\n\nWe'll assign:\n\n- 2161: low (random new player)\n- 2162: low (academic departure)\n- 2163: low (player retirement)\n- 2164: low\n- 2165: low\n- 2166: low\n- 2167: low\n- 2168: low\n- 2169: low\n- 2170: low\n- 2171: low\n- 2172: low\n- 2173: low\n- 2174: low\n- 2175: low\n- 2176: low\n- 2177: low\n- 2178: low\n- 2179: low\n- 2180: impossible\n\nBut maybe some could be medium: e.g., joining major clubs like São Paulo FC, CS Sedan, Texas Longhorns, etc. But still plausible but not certain.

Determine possible_in_2026 boolean, and likelihood categories: impossible, low, medium, high.\n\nWe need to check factual accuracy: are the people real? Many names may be obscure. If they are not known public figures, it's plausible they could have such employment changes. The German Research Foundation (DFG) is a real organization; people could join/leave. Dates are specific Monday July 13, 2026. Need to check if July 13, 2026 is a Monday. Let's compute: 2026-07-13. 2026 is not a leap year (2024 leap, 2025 normal, 2026 normal). Jan 1 2026 day? Known: Jan 1 2025 is Wednesday (since 2024 leap year, Jan 1 2024 Monday? Actually Jan 1 2024 is Monday. 2024 leap adds 2 days, so Jan 1 2025 is Wednesday. 2025 normal adds 1 day, so Jan 1 2026 is Thursday. Then July 13 is day number: Jan31, Feb28, Mar31, Apr30, May31, Jun30 = 181 days up to Jun30. Add 13 => 194. Starting Thursday Jan1 = day 0 Thursday. 194 days later: 194 mod 7 = 5 (since 7*27=189, remainder5). Thursday +5 = Tuesday? Thursday->Friday(1), Saturday(2), Sunday(3), Monday(4), Tuesday(5). So July 13 2026 is Tuesday, not Monday. So many descriptions claim Monday July 13, 2026 which is inaccurate. That makes factual plausibility low but not impossible (they could be mistaken). The question: evaluate factual accuracy: are people, orgs realistic? Many are plausible but some like \"Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball team\" is a college team; a person joining as player? Could be plausible. \"France Télécom\" is now Orange; still exists as corporate entity; joining plausible.\n\nThus overall scenario: each item is a simple employment change on that date. The date being Monday is inaccurate, but could still happen on July 13 2026 (Tuesday). The description's claim of Monday is false, making factual accuracy questionable. But the evaluation is about plausibility of the event, not about the description's correctness? The instruction: \"Factual Accuracy: Are the people, organizations, and relationships mentioned realistic and factually plausible?\" So we need to assess if the described relationship (person employed by org) is plausible. The date being Monday may be a factual error, reducing plausibility but not making impossible. So likely \"low\" likelihood.\n\nWe need to assign possible_in_2026 = true unless absolutely impossible. None are impossible. So all true.\n\nLikelihood categories: maybe \"low\" for most because specific date and unknown persons; but could be \"medium\" for generic employment changes. I'd assign \"low\" to many, \"medium\" to some where organization and person plausible. But keep simple: all \"low\" maybe.\n\nRationale: concise <=2 sentences.\n\nWe must output JSON with results array in same order.\n\nLet's craft each entry.\n\nWe'll need to include id as string (per schema).

Provide JSON with results array in same order. For each, determine possible_in_2026 (true if not impossible) and likelihood (impossible, low, medium, high). Provide concise rationale <=2 sentences.\n\nWe need to consider factual accuracy: are the people real, are they plausible to be members of those organizations at that time? Many names may be fictional or mismatched (e.g., Vitalis Takawira? Not known; FC Winterthur is Swiss club; could have a player with that name). We need to assess plausibility: If the person is likely not real or age mismatch, maybe impossible. But we can consider possibility low if unknown.\n\nWe must be strict: If absolutely impossible (e.g., Yotaro Kobayashi joining Seattle Sounders from 1994 to 2008 as of 2026, i.e., joining a team in the past, contradictory), that's impossible. Also \"joined Seattle Sounders, a team he will be part of from 1994 to 2008, as of July 31st, 2026\" suggests time travel; impossible. So possible_in_2026 false, likelihood impossible.\n\nSimilarly, \"Victoria Pelova is set to depart AFC Ajax's women's team\" but Pelova is a male Dutch player currently in women's? Actually Victoria Pelova is a female Dutch footballer playing for Arsenal (women) as of 2023. She could be in Ajax women's team? She is a real player, plausible to depart in 2026. Likelihood maybe medium.\n\nCheck each:\n\nWe'll go through each id.\n\nGeneral approach: If name is real and plausible age for 2026 (e.g., born 1990s, still playing), plausible. If name unknown but could be a player, plausible low.\n\nIf organization mismatch (e.g., \"Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball team\" - roster change in July (offseason) plausible). So likely possible.\n\nIf date is a Friday July 31 2026: Need to verify day of week. Let's check: 2026-07-31. 2026 is not a leap year (2024 leap, 2025 normal, 2026 normal). Jan 1 2026 is Thursday? Actually 2025 Jan 1 is Wednesday (2024 leap year adds extra day). Let's compute: 2024 Jan 1 Monday? Actually 2024 is leap year, Jan 1 2024 is Monday (I think). Then 2025 Jan 1 is Wednesday, 2026 Jan 1 is Thursday. July 31 2026: days from Jan 1 to July 31: Jan31, Feb28, Mar31, Apr30, May31, Jun30, Jul31 = 212 days. 212 mod 7 = 212 - 210 = 2. Starting Thursday + 212 days => Thursday + 2 = Saturday. So July 31 2026 is Saturday, not Friday. Many descriptions say Friday July 31 2026, which is inaccurate. That could affect factual accuracy. But plausibility? Could be a mistake but still possible that event occurs on that date regardless of day label. The description says \"Friday, July 31st, 2026\". Since day is wrong, factual inaccuracy. But does that make scenario impossible? Not necessarily; it's just a minor error. Likely still possible. So we treat as plausible.\n\nNow evaluate each:\n\n2281: Vitalis Takawira - unknown player. Could be a footballer at FC Winterthur. No known record, but plausible. Likelihood low to medium. We'll set possible true, likelihood low.\n\nRationale: No known player, but clubs can have unknown signings.\n\n2282: Mark Anglavar - unknown, Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball. Could be a player leaving. Likely plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n2283: Mohsen Moazzami-Gudarzi at Amirkabir University of Technology (Iran). Could be a professor leaving. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n2284: Gregory joins Swindon Town FC on July 31 2026. No surname, but plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n2285: Yotaro Kobayashi joined Seattle Sounders from 1994 to 2008 as of 2026. Time travel impossible. So impossible.\n\n2286: Pierce leaves West Texas A&M Buffaloes Men's Basketball. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n2287: Gilbert Lazard membership with Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres ends 2026. Gilbert Lazard (French linguist) died 2018. So cannot be member in 2026. Impossible. So possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n2288: Claudinho born 1980, parting ways with Clube Atlético Mineiro in 2026. He would be 46, unlikely still player. Could be staff? But description says footballer. Unlikely but not impossible if retired and still registered? Usually not. Likelihood low? Might be impossible for active player. Could be improbable but not impossible if he is a veteran still registered? Very unlikely. I'd set possible true, likelihood low (maybe medium). But we need to decide. I'd say low.\n\nRationale: Age 46 makes active playing unlikely.\n\n2289: Vlado Janković leaves P.A.O.K. BC (basketball club). He is a Serbian basketball player born 1990, would be 36 in 2026, plausible still playing. Likelihood medium.\n\n22890 (id 2290): Jessie A. Elliott joins Ventforet Kofu (Japanese football club). Unknown person, plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n2291: Ted Williams departs Wichita State Shockers men's basketball. Ted Williams is a common name; plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n2292: Lee Morrison, soccer player, leaves US U20 national team in 2026. U20 players are under 20, so would be born 2006 or later, age 20 in 2026. Could be leaving after age limit. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n2293: Victoria Pelova departs AFC Ajax women's team in 2026. She is a real player, currently at Arsenal (women) as of 2023. Could transfer. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n2294: Charlene Harris leaves German Research Foundation (DFG) in 2026. Could be a researcher. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n2295: Alison M Taylor leaves Zamalek SC (Egyptian club) in 2026. Unknown but plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n2296: Robinson Blandón joins San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball in 2026. Unknown but plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n2297: Anna Ajduk leaves SpVgg Greuther Fürth in 2026. Unknown but plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n2298: Meelis Lindmaa leaves Tampereen Pallo-Veikot in 2026. Unknown but plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n2299: Lev Kornilov leaves FC Luch Vladivostok in 2026. Unknown but plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n2300: Ted Scott leaves Pepperdine Waves men's basketball in 2026. Unknown but plausible. Likelihood low.\n\nNow produce JSON with results array in order, each object with id as string (must be string).

He is a German footballer (born 1999) currently playing for... He played for FC St. Pauli, then maybe moved to other clubs. Ashton United F.C. is an English non-league club (Northern Premier League). Could a professional like Adrion join Ashton United? Possibly but unlikely due to level. However not impossible. So possible_in_2026 = true. Likelihood maybe low (unlikely). Rationale: Adrion is a professional player; moving to a lower-tier English club is improbable but not impossible.\n\n2322: Igor Bugaiov. He is a Moldovan footballer, retired? He was born 1975, likely retired. FC Academia Chișinău is a Moldovan club that dissolved in 2017. So being a member in 2026 is impossible. So possible_in_2026 = false, likelihood \"impossible\". Rationale: Club ceased operations in 2017; Bugaiov retired.\n\n2323: Zbigniew Grzybowski. He is a Polish footballer born 1978, retired. Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles is a Japanese baseball team (NPB). He is a footballer, not baseball. So being a member of that baseball team is impossible. So false, impossible.\n\n2324: Cormac J O' Shea. Not sure if real person. Could be fictional. Clermont Foot is a French football club. No known person. Could be plausible that a person with that name joins. Since no evidence of impossibility, treat as possible but low likelihood due to unknown. So true, low.\n\n2325: Dmytro Matviyenko. Could be a Ukrainian name. University of Bonn is a German university. Could be a student or researcher. No reason impossible. So true, medium (reasonable). Rationale: plausible academic affiliation ending.\n\n2326: Keelan Cairns. Not known. La Vitréenne FC is a French lower-league club. Could be plausible. So true, low-medium. Let's set medium.\n\n2327: Jason Tsz Him Cheung. Not known. SC Tavriya Simferopol is a Ukrainian football club (re-established). Could be plausible. So true, low.\n\n2328: Liza Minnelli. Famous singer/actress, born 1946. HFC Haarlem is a Dutch football club (defunct? Actually HFC Haarlem was dissolved in 2010). So impossible. Also Liza Minnelli joining a football club is implausible. So false, impossible.\n\n2329: Jimmer Fredette. Former BYU basketball star, now pro overseas. He left BYU long ago. Could be still listed as member? By 2026, he would be 38, unlikely to be on college team. So impossible (cannot be member). So false, impossible.\n\n2330: Raquel Toribio-Fernández. Not known. Birkbeck, University of London is real. Could be a staff or student. Plausible. So true, medium.\n\n2331: Malick Fall, professional footballer. He is a Senegalese footballer born 1995, currently playing for clubs. A.C. Juvenes/Dogana is a San Marino club. Could join. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n2332: \"individual began their journey at Le Portel\" - vague, location. No specific person. Could be any person. Since no impossibility, treat as possible but unknown. Likelihood low. But scenario is generic; plausible. So true, low.\n\n2333: Kyle Peterson. Not known. Army Black Knights men's basketball team (US Military Academy). Could be a player. Plausible. So true, medium.\n\n2334: Tyreek Scott-Grayson. Not known. UAB Blazers men's basketball. Plausible. So true, medium.\n\n2335: Gurgen Hovnan. Not known. Belmont Bruins men's basketball. Plausible. So true, medium.\n\n2336: Piotr Gierlak joining University of Strasbourg. Could be staff. Plausible. So true, medium.\n\n2337: Lydia Shum. Famous Hong Kong actress (born 1936) died 2008. So impossible. Also Stade Brestois 29 is French football club. So false, impossible.\n\n2338: Piet Brussaard joining German Research Foundation (DFG). Could be plausible. So true, medium.\n\n2339: Julian Jacobs, basketball player, leaving USC Trojans. Could be plausible. So true, medium.\n\n2340: Ernst-Christoph Meier at German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP). He is a real person (German political scientist). Could leave in 2026. Plausible. So true, medium.\n\nNow assign likelihood categories: For plausible but ordinary events, medium. For unlikely but possible, low. For impossible, \"impossible\". For high likelihood (very likely) maybe none. But maybe some like academic affiliation ending is likely. Could assign high for typical contract ending? But guidelines: use low/medium/high.

Jordi Roca is a chef (World's Best). No known footballer. Could be a different person with same name? But description says \"the footballer\". Unlikely. So impossible. possible_in_2026 = false, likelihood \"impossible\". Rationale: Jordi Roca is known as chef, not professional footballer; no record of playing for Terrassa FC.\n\nID 2342: Viktor Miklós, player for FC DAC 1904 Dunajská Streda. I don't know if such player exists. Could be plausible. Viktor Miklós is a Hungarian name; there is a player Viktor Miklós (born 2000) who plays for DAC? Actually there is a Hungarian midfielder Viktor Miklós who played for DAC? I recall a player named Viktor Miklós (born 2000) who played for DAC. So plausible that he could leave in 2026. So possible_in_2026 = true. Likelihood maybe medium (since transfers happen). Rationale: Player exists and could depart.\n\nID 2343: Øyvind Gjerde, Lillestrøm SK. Øyvind Gjerde is a former Norwegian footballer, retired. He was born 1977, retired long ago. By 2026 he'd be 49, unlikely to be player. Could be staff? But description says tenure as member (player). Improbable. So impossible. possible false.\n\nID 2344: Victoria Sanford, Centro Giovanile Virescit Boccaleone. Not known. Could be a youth player. No info. Could be plausible but unknown. Likelihood low? Since no known person, but could be fictional. The instruction: evaluate factual accuracy. If person not known, treat as implausible? Might be impossible if no evidence.

Even if unknown, it's plausible that a person named Victoria Sanford could be in that club. So possible true, likelihood low.

Some may be obscure or possibly fictional. If person is not known, we can't verify; but plausibility: could they be real? Many names seem plausible but not necessarily known. The instruction: \"Base the judgment on general plausibility by 2026 (not certainty).\" So we consider if scenario is possible.

If person is known and age makes scenario impossible (e.g., Jack Cameron born 1931 would be 95 in 2026, unlikely to be a footballer leaving a club). That would be impossible. Also John Hannah footballer joining basketball team - unlikely but possible? John Hannah is a former NFL player, not football (soccer) but American football. Could join basketball? Unlikely but not impossible? Might be improbable. We'll assign low.\n\nAlso some organizations: Broad Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, etc. People may not be known; we assume plausible employment changes.\n\nWe need to assess each.\n\nLet's go through each id.\n\n2421: Eleonella Bartoli? Not known. Could be a professor. Leaving UT Health Science Center Houston on Aug 1 2026. Plausible. Likelihood high (common). possible true.\n\n2422: John Hannah, the footballer, joins Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball team. John Hannah is a former NFL offensive lineman (born 1951). Not a soccer player. But description says footballer (maybe soccer). Could be a different John Hannah. Could join college basketball team as player? He would be 45 in 2026, too old for college basketball. So impossible. possible_in_2026 false, likelihood impossible.\n\n2423: John Gagnon leaves Broad Institute. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n2424: Ivo Rossen joins CFR Cluj (Romanian football club). Ivo Rossen is a Dutch footballer born 1979, would be 47 in 2026, unlikely to join as player but could join as staff. Description says member, ambiguous. Could be plausible as staff. Likelihood medium.\n\n2425: Peter Remie no longer member of RBC Roosendaal (Dutch football club). Could be plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n2426: Jack Cameron born 1931, leaving Hartlepool United F.C. in 2026 at age 95. Impossible as player, maybe as staff? But description says footballer, leaving as member. Likely impossible. possible false.\n\n2427: Man Zhang joins Radboud University Nijmegen. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n2428: Dániel Lettrich leaves Western New York Flash. The Flash is a women's soccer team that folded in 2016; rebranded as NY Fury? Actually Western New York Flash ceased operations 2016. So by 2026, team does not exist. So impossible. possible false.\n\n2429: Kug-Seung Lee leaves University of Texas at Austin. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n2430: Jacob Neubert leaves Baylor Bears men's basketball team. Could be plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n2431: Ruslan Mukhametshin joins Toronto Falcons, tenure until 1968 (past). This is contradictory: joining in 2026 but ending in 1968. Impossible. Likelihood impossible.\n\n2432: Prakash Priyadarshi Praharaj leaves National Institute of Science Education and Research. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n2433: Rob Johnson leaves University of Nottingham. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n2434: Jaclyn Kline leaves NIAID. Plausible.

For impossible, \"impossible\". Provide rationale <=2 sentences.\n\nLet's decide:\n\n2421: high (common staff change). Rationale: No contradictory info; such employment changes are routine.\n\n2422: impossible (age and sport mismatch). Rationale: John Hannah would be far older than typical college basketball player, making scenario impossible.\n\n2423: high.\n\n2424: medium (age for player but could be staff). Rationale: Ivo Rossen would be 47, unlikely as player but could join in non-playing capacity.\n\n2425: high.\n\n2426: impossible (age 95). Rationale: At 95, cannot be active footballer; scenario impossible.\n\n2427: high.\n\n2428: impossible (team defunct). Rationale: Western New York Flash ceased operations in 2016, so cannot have staff in 2026.\n\n2429: high.\n\n2430: high.\n\n2431: impossible (temporal inconsistency).

The instruction: \"Base the judgment on general plausibility by 2026 (not certainty).\" If scenario is absolutely impossible, then possible_in_2026 = false, otherwise true. So even if person unknown, it's not impossible they could join. However some organizations may not exist (e.g., Halifax Rainmen is a former basketball team that folded in 2015). So joining them in 2026 is impossible because team no longer exists. Similarly Durham Storm? Not sure. AGOVV is a Dutch football club that was dissolved in 2013, but revived as amateur? Might be possible. Need to evaluate each.\n\nLet's go through each:\n\n2441: Patryk Klofik joining Carnegie Mellon University as a member (maybe as faculty). No known person; plausible. Likelihood: low to medium? Since unknown but possible. I'd say possible_in_2026 = true, likelihood low (since no evidence). Rationale: No known record but joining a university is plausible.\n\n2442: Ming Chen's tenure with West Ham United F.C. ended Aug 1 2026. Ming Chen is a common name; could be staff. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n2443: Jakub Sylvestr joining Halifax Rainmen. Halifax Rainmen were a basketball team that folded 2015. No team in 2026. So impossible. possible_in_2026 false, likelihood impossible. Rationale: team ceased operations.\n\n2444: Jasper Ameye departs Cercle Brugge K.S.V. (football club). Jasper Ameye is a real Belgian footballer (born 1995) who played for Cercle Brugge earlier. As of 2026, could be still there; departure plausible. Likelihood medium. possible true.\n\n2445: Michele Gallo set to join FC Gueugnon on Aug 1 2026. Michele Gallo maybe a player; FC Gueugnon is a French club currently in lower divisions, still exists. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n2446: Marcus Stergiopoulos no longer member of Florida State Seminoles men's basketball team as of Aug 1 2026. Marcus Stergiopoulos not known; could be a player. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n2447: Unnamed individual joins Sydney United 58 FC on Aug 1 2026. Unnamed but statement says new face has joined. Since unnamed, can't verify but plausible that someone joins. Likelihood low.\n\n2448: Jacques Hurtubise, a renowned mathematician, joins Durham Storm as of Aug 1 2026. Jacques Hurtubise (Canadian mathematician) died 2019. So impossible to join in 2026. Also Durham Storm? Not sure, maybe a sports team. But the person is deceased, so impossible. possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n2449: Bill Houghton joins AGOVV as of Aug 1 2026. AGOVV (Dutch football club) was dissolved 2013 but reformed as amateur club AGOVV Apeldoorn, still active. Bill Houghton unknown but plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n2450: Ana Sol Gutierrez no longer member of Montgomery County Board Of Education as of Aug 1 2026. Plausible.

Likelihood low.\n\n2452: Thomas Woods no longer member of Southeastern Louisiana Lions basketball team as of Aug 1 2026. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n2453: Michael Daskalakis no longer member of Ardèche. Ardèche is a French department, not an organization. \"Member of Ardèche\" ambiguous; maybe a club named Ardèche? Likely impossible because you can't be a member of a region. So impossible. possible false.\n\n2454: Emin Khachaturian departs Northwich Victoria F.C. as of Aug 1 2026. Emin Khachaturian unknown, but club exists (non-league). Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n2455: Thomas Johan Jørgensen joins Idaho Vandals men's basketball team as staff on Aug 1 2026. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n2456: Daniel Rukavina departs North Florida Ospreys men's basketball team as of Aug 1 2026. Plausible.

Impossible. possible false.\n\n2458: Hayrettin Demirbaş no longer member of University Of Sistan And Baluchistan Faculty Of Engineering as of Aug 1 2026. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n2459: Mansour Ghalehnovi tenure with Zeytinburnuspor ends Aug 1 2026. Zeytinburnuspor is a Turkish football club currently in lower leagues, plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n2460: Raúl González (born 1991) set to join Cagliari Calcio on Aug 1 2026. Raúl González is a common name; there is a Spanish footballer Raúl González (born 1977) retired.

Actually Tavriya Simferopol was dissolved in 2014; a phoenix club \"Tavriya Simferopol\" was re-founded in 2016 and plays in Ukrainian lower leagues. Could a person be a member? Possibly. So plausible.\n\n- Sanjoy K. Deb: Not known; could be a person, but joining Northeastern Illinois Golden Eagles men's basketball team as a player? That is a college team (Northeastern Illinois University). Could a person named Sanjoy Deb be a player? Possibly but unusual name for basketball. Could be a coach. Plausibility moderate.\n\n- Atef Abu Bilal: Not known; Shabab Al-Khalil SC is a Palestinian football club. Could be a player. Plausible.\n\n- Diego da Silva, footballer born 1985, parting ways with Missouri State Bears basketball team. That's odd: a footballer playing basketball for a college team at age 41 (2026). Unlikely. So impossible.\n\n- Lorenz Jaeger joining CR Flamengo (Brazilian football club). Could be plausible if he's a player or staff. Name plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n- Marta L Mccrum ending membership with Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe. Could be a researcher. Plausible.\n\n- André Schembri: He is a Maltese footballer, retired, previously played for Lyn Fotball (Norwegian club) in 2012. By 2026, he could be staff. Departure plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n- Mohamad Jaamour with Al-Karamah SC (Syrian club). Plausible.\n\n- Christopher Seward no longer employed at Harvard Medical School.

Could be plausible if retired. Likelihood medium.\n\n- Stan Worthy joins Athletic Bilbao. Not known; Athletic Bilbao only signs Basque players. If Stan Worthy is not Basque, impossible. Name sounds English. So likely impossible.\n\n- Bill Lewis joins Carnegie Institution for Science. Plausible.\n\n- Cristian Quiñones no longer member of Fort Lauderdale Strikers, team existed historically but folded 2016. So being a member until 2026 impossible. So impossible.\n\nNow assign likelihood: For plausible but uncertain, maybe low or medium.

He would be 93, unlikely to be a player but could be a staff? The description says \"renowned footballer born in 1933, has officially parted ways with Bath City F.C. as of August 27, 2026, marking the end of his membership\". Could be a non-playing role, but \"renowned footballer\" implies player. At 93, impossible to be active player. But could be a ceremonial membership. The phrase \"parted ways\" suggests leaving a club as a player? Likely impossible as a player. But could be as a member (e.g., ambassador). We'll consider plausible? The scenario is ambiguous. Probably low plausibility but not impossible.

Cornes\" - plausible.\n\n\"Deedar Nabi\" - plausible.\n\n\"Jia-Xu Chen\" - plausible.\n\n\"Roger Jouve\" - real French footballer born 1949, would be 77. Could join JEF United Chiba as staff? But \"joined\" as player improbable. But could be a staff. Likelihood low but possible.\n\n\"Daniele Canzani\" - unknown.\n\n\"John Whorton\" - unknown.\n\n\"John King, renowned footballer born 1933\" - real? Not known. Could be fictional.

If he is a student, plausible.\n\n\"John King\" scenario: maybe as a member (e.g., honorary).

So possible_in_2026 = true, likelihood maybe medium.\n\n2582: Richard Lenski ending membership with FC Girondis de Bordeaux. Richard Lenski is a famous evolutionary biologist, not a football player. Unlikely he is a member of a French football club. That is implausible. Could be impossible? It's not impossible for a scientist to be a member of a football club (maybe as a player? but Lenski is older, born 1956, would be 70 in 2026, not a professional player).

Kernberg ending affiliation with Pennsylvania State University. Otto Kernberg is a psychiatrist born 1943, would be 83 in 2026.

Provide concise rationale <=2 sentences.\n\nWe need to assess factual accuracy: are the people real? Many names may be obscure or possibly fictional. If a person is not known to exist, scenario may be impossible? But could be a real person not public. The instruction: \"Base the judgment on general plausibility by 2026 (not certainty).\" So if the person is unknown, we can assume plausible they exist. However some organizations like \"Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens men's basketball team\" is a college team (University of Delaware). A person named \"Modřany Power\" seems unlikely (Power as surname, Modřany is a district). Could be fictional. Likelihood low.\n\nWe need to decide impossible vs possible. Impossible would be something that cannot happen (e.g., date in past relative to 2026? All dates are Aug/Sep 2026, which is future relative to now (2025). So possible. Unless the person is deceased or retired impossibly. Eg Tim Hunter professional ice hockey player? There is a Tim Hunter (former NHL player) born 1960, retired long ago. He could not be a current player in 2026. So that scenario is impossible (a retired player cannot announce departure as a player). So possible_in_2026 = false, likelihood \"impossible\".\n\nSimilarly, \"Kenny Murphy\" maybe a soccer player? Could be plausible. \"Philippe Périlleux\" unknown. \"José Vantolrá\" unknown.\n\nCheck each:\n\n2621 Rosaura Esteve-Puig: Not known. Could be a researcher. Joining Université de Namur plausible.

So impossible.\n\n2624 Juan Francisco Vázquez Costa no longer member of Foshan University. Could be plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n2625 Sander Post no longer member of FK Jagodina. Sander Post is an Estonian basketball player, not football. FK Jagodina is a Serbian football club. So mismatch. Could be improbable but could be a different person with same name. Likelihood low.\n\n2626 Dylanne Dearborn left University of Toronto. Unknown person, plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n2627 Kenny Murphy departs Australian National Team (soccer).

Schott set to start membership with FC Vityaz Podolsk (Russian club). Unknown, plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n2634 Eugene Han left Yonsei University. Could be plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n2635 José Vantolrá joined Slovakia national football team. Unknown, plausible but national team usually selects citizens; could be naturalized. Likelihood low to medium.\n\n2636 Modřany Power joined Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens men's basketball team. Name seems fictional; also a college team rarely signs unknown players; could be a student. Plausible but low.\n\n2637 Amy Finnegan departs CS Sporting Vaslui (Romanian club). Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n2638 Viktor Baryakhtar joined Délégation Ile-De-France Ouest Et Nord (some organization). Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n2639 Eglė Arbačiauskienė joined Colombia national under-17 football team. Unlikely due to nationality (Lithuanian name) joining Colombian U17. Could be naturalized but improbable. Likelihood low.\n\n2640 Andritany Ardhiyasa no longer member of Indonesia national under-23 football team. Andritany Ardhiyasa is an Indonesian goalkeeper, born 1995, could be in U23? By 2026 he would be 31, too old for U23. So impossible. So possible_in_2026 false, likelihood impossible.\n\nNow assign likelihood categories: For possible ones, choose high if very plausible (common academic hire). Medium for typical but not certain.

If unknown, we assume plausible unless obviously impossible (e.g., age issues). For example, Sophia Smith born 1978, in 2026 she would be 48, still could be part of women's national team? Unlikely for a player, but could be a staff? The description says \"footballer\" and \"parted ways with the Greece women's national football team\". At 48, unlikely to be an active player, but could be a coach. Since described as footballer, improbable. So likely low or impossible? Probably low plausibility but not impossible if she was a veteran? But as a player, impossible. So we might set possible_in_2026 = false? The rule: if absolutely impossible, false. I'd say it's highly unlikely but not absolutely impossible (maybe she could be a non-playing staff). But description says \"footballer\". I'd mark possible_in_2026 = false? Might be considered impossible for a 48-year-old to be a player on national team. I'd set false.\n\nCamila França joining England cricket team: She is presumably Brazilian? Not known.

Many names may be obscure but could exist. Some are impossible: e.g., \"Helmut Schön\" is a famous German football manager who died 1996, cannot be member in 2026. So impossible.\n\nAlso \"Alice Cooper\" is a rock band; adding \"Chad Mcclendon\" as new member plausible? Could be but band lineup changes possible. So plausible.\n\nCheck dates: September 3 2026 is a Thursday? Let's verify: 2026-09-03 day of week. 2026 is not leap year. Use known: 2024-02-29 is Thursday? Actually 2024-02-29 is Thursday. Compute day offset to 2026-09-03. Too time-consuming; but we can approximate: 2025-09-03 day? 2025 is not leap year. 2024-09-03 was Tuesday? Let's quickly compute: 2024-01-01 Monday (2024 is leap year). Actually 2024-01-01 is Monday (I think). Then 2024-09-03: days from Jan1 to Sep3: Jan31,Feb29,Mar31,Apr30,May31,Jun30,Jul31,Aug31 = 244 days, plus 2 days (since Sep3 is day 3) => 247 days. 247 mod7 = 247-7*35=247-245=2. Monday +2 = Wednesday. So 2024-09-03 is Wednesday. Add 365 days for 2025 (non-leap) => 2025-09-03 is Thursday (Wednesday+1). Add 365 days for 2026 => 2026-09-03 is Friday (Thursday+1). Wait check: 2025 not leap, 2026 not leap. So 2026-09-03 is Friday, not Thursday. Many descriptions claim Thursday. So timeline feasibility: mismatch makes implausible but not impossible? The date being a Thursday is factually inaccurate. So likely impossible? The scenario says \"as of Thursday, September 3rd, 2026\". Since day-of-week is wrong, factual accuracy is off. That could be considered unrealistic but could be a mistake, but we evaluate plausibility: It's a factual error, but the event could still happen on that date regardless of day-of-week. The description includes wrong day-of-week, making it factually inaccurate. The instruction: \"Are the people, organizations, and relationships mentioned realistic and factually plausible?\" So day-of-week mismatch counts as factual inaccuracy. So likely impossible? Might be low but still possible that description is just mis-stated. I'd lean to \"low\" likelihood but possible_in_2026 = true because event could still happen; the error doesn't make it impossible. However many items are simple employment changes; plausible.\n\nWe need to assign likelihood categories: impossible, low, medium, high.\n\nWe'll treat each:\n\n2741: Allan H. Morrish joining \"Rksv Fcv Venlo\". This organization seems like a Dutch football club? Actually \"RKSv FCV Venlo\"? Not known. Could be fictional. Likelihood low. possible true? Could be plausible if organization exists. We'll set possible true, likelihood low.\n\n2742: Hao Zheng joining Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party (historical communist party dissolved 1989). It no longer exists; unlikely to have new members in 2026. So impossible. possible false.\n\n2743: Eric C. Hellgren leaving Southern Illinois University Carbondale. Plausible. Likelihood medium-high. We'll set possible true, likelihood medium.\n\n2744: Chad Mcclendon joining Alice Cooper band. Could happen; band lineup changes.

If fictional, scenario could still be plausible (someone could have that tenure). The question: \"Base the judgment on general plausibility by 2026 (not certainty).\" If the person is unknown, we can't say impossible; it's plausible they exist. However some organizations may not have such positions (e.g., \"Arrondissement Of Bordj-Menaiel\" joining FC Rubin Kazan as a member? That seems odd: an arrondissement (administrative district) cannot be a member of a football club. So likely impossible.\n\nSimilarly \"San Francisco Dons men's basketball team\" is a college team; a player named Vince Boyle could be plausible. But we need to consider timeline: by 2026, could a player be on that team? College players are typically 18-22, so could be. No reason impossible.\n\nCheck each:\n\n2761: Palanivel Chinnakali at AIIMS Kalyani. AIIMS Kalyani is a real institute (established 2012). Person unknown but plausible.

An arrondissement (administrative region in Algeria) cannot be a member of a football club. This is implausible.

Person plausible. Likelihood medium-high. Probably possible.\n\n2770: Sebastien Vorbe no longer a member of LA Galaxy as of Sep 7 2026. Vorbe is a real former MLS player (born 1970). By 2026 he'd be 56, unlikely to be a player but could be staff. The description says \"member of LA Galaxy\" ambiguous. Could be staff. But \"member\" likely player. At 56, improbable. Could be impossible as player. But could be a coach. Since not specified, ambiguous. I'd assign low plausibility for player but possible as staff.

Likelihood medium-high.\n\n2772: Nathalie Sibille left Unité De Glycobiologie Structurale Et Fonctionnelle (a research unit) effective Sep 7 2026. Plausible.

Likelihood high.\n\n2774: Víctor García, professional cyclist, left Depredadores Prado Credit on Sep 8 2026. Depredadores Prado Credit? Not known as a cycling team. Could be a sponsor team? Might be fictional. Professional cyclist could leave a team. Likelihood medium.\n\n2775: Mike Sorber no longer a member of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory as of Sep 8 2026. Mike Sorber is a former soccer player, not a scientist. Could be a staff? Unlikely. But could be a consultant. Plausibility low.\n\n2776: Vladimir Markotić joined West Bromwich Albion F.C. on Sep 8 2026. Plausible as a player (maybe age). Likelihood medium-high.\n\n2777: Bob Jack joined New York Red Bulls on Sep 8 2026. Bob Jack is a historic Scottish footballer (died 1949). So impossible.

If person is deceased or unrealistic (e.g., older footballer), then impossible.\n\nWe need to assess each.\n\nLet's examine each item.\n\nWe need to know real individuals:\n\n- Alex Hay: Not sure. Could be a footballer? There is a Scottish footballer Alex Hay? Actually Alex Hay is a Scottish footballer born 1999? Not sure. Cammell Laird 1907 F.C. is a lower league English club. Could a notable footballer be there? Possibly but \"notable\" maybe unrealistic but plausible.\n\n- Michel Morandais: He is a French basketball player, not footballer. Limoges FC is a football club. So mismatch: Michel Morandais is a basketball player, not footballer. So factual implausibility. Likelihood low to impossible? Could he switch sports? Unlikely. So likely impossible.\n\n- László Nagy: There is a Hungarian footballer László Nagy (born 1998) playing for FC Luzern currently (as of 2023). By 2026, he could leave. So plausible.\n\n- Aleksandr Dedurin: Not known. FC Smena Komsomolsk-na-Amure is a Russian club. Could be plausible but unknown. We'll treat as plausible (low info). So possible.\n\n- José Borello: There was an Argentine footballer José Borello (1929-2013) died. So cannot join in 2026. So impossible.\n\n- Sarah Zubairy: She is a real professor (MIT) in quantum computing. German Research Foundation (DFG) is a funding agency, not typical employer. She could be a member of DFG? Possibly as a reviewer or board member. Plausible but unlikely. But possible.\n\n- Maeve Quinlan: Actress, not known as researcher. Could be part of DFG? Unlikely. But possible as staff? Probably impossible. We'll set low.\n\n- Mike Brannen: Not known. Dayton Flyers men's basketball team is NCAA. Could be a player. Plausible.\n\n- Eman Abu-Gharbieh: Not known. Dubai Pharmacy College (maybe Dubai Pharmacy College is a real institution). Could be plausible.\n\n- José Fernando Cuadrado: Not known. Deportivo Cali is Colombian football club. Could be plausible.\n\n- Tom Villemure: Not known. Detroit Mercy Titans men's basketball team. Plausible.\n\n- Khalid Ismail: Not known. UAE national football team.

He is \"notable footballer\" leaving a lower league club. Could be plausible. We'll set medium-high. Use \"medium\". Could be high. I'll set \"medium\". Rationale: plausible transfer.\n\n2782 Michel Morandais joining Limoges FC (football) but he's a basketball player. Improbable. Likelihood low? I'd say impossible because career switch unlikely. But not impossible. We'll set possible_in_2026 = false? The rule: if absolutely impossible, false. It's not absolutely impossible, but highly implausible. So possible = true, likelihood low. Rationale: mismatch of sport.\n\n2783 László Nagy leaving FC Luzern: plausible. Likelihood high. possible true.\n\n2784 Aleksandr Dedurin leaving FC Smena Komsomolsk-na-Amure: plausible, unknown but possible. Likelihood medium.\n\n2785 José Borello joining FSC Rybinsk: Borello dead. impossible. possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n2786 Sarah Zubairy joining German Research Foundation: plausible as member of board. Likelihood low-medium. We'll set medium.\n\n2787 Maeve Quinlan leaving German Research Foundation: No known affiliation, but could be staff.

Most are simple roster changes, which are plausible. Need to consider if the persons exist and are likely to be on those teams. Many names may be fictional. The instruction: \"Base the judgment on general plausibility by 2026 (not certainty).\" If scenario is absolutely impossible (e.g., person dead before 2026, or team doesn't exist), then possible_in_2026 = false. Otherwise true. Likelihood categories: impossible, low, medium, high.\n\nWe need to assess each. Likely many are low to medium because we don't know. But we can consider that roster changes happen frequently, so plausible. However, some may be impossible because the team doesn't have a men's basketball team (e.g., Eastern Michigan Eagles men's basketball exists, okay). UMBC Retrievers men's basketball exists. Hawaii Rainbow Warriors basketball exists. Odra Wodzisław Śląski is a Polish football club, plausible. University of Maryland, College Park staff departure plausible. Droylsden F.C. exists (English non-league). Tôn Đức Thắng University exists in Vietnam. Bali United F.C. exists. Spezia Calcio exists. Sapporo City General Hospital plausible as an institution; a person could leave. FC Znamya Truda Orekhovo-Zuyevo exists. Delaware County Community College exists. Los Alamos National Laboratory exists. Weill Cornell Medicine exists. Port Vale F.C. exists. Socialists' Party of Catalonia exists. Guyana Amazon Warriors (cricket T20) exists. St. John's Red Storm men's basketball exists. San Diego Toreros men's basketball exists. Tasmania cricket team exists.\n\nThus all are plausible. The only potential impossibility: some names may be known as deceased before 2026 (e.g., Chadwick Walton is a cricketer born 1985, still alive, plausible. Maurice Adams? Not known. Could be fictional but plausible. So all possible.\n\nLikelihood: Since roster changes are common, high plausibility. But we have no evidence; we can assign \"medium\" to many, \"high\" to generic staff changes. Probably assign \"high\" for typical roster changes? The instruction: \"likelihood\" categories: impossible, low, medium, high. Since not impossible, we can choose low/medium/high based on how likely such a specific event is. Since it's a specific individual's departure on a specific date, that's a specific claim; probability of being true is low. So maybe \"low\". But we are evaluating plausibility, not probability of truth. Plausibility is high (it could happen). So I'd set \"high\" for all.\n\nBut to differentiate, maybe some are less plausible: e.g., \"Riley Barker\" at Weill Cornell Medicine - could be a researcher leaving; plausible.

Administrative changes could merge communes; but \"ceased to be located\" is odd. Could be that Melay merged into Chemillé-Melay, losing separate status. That is plausible: French communes merge. So possible true. Likelihood medium.\n\nBut description says \"ceased to be located at Chemillé-Melay\" which is weird. But plausible that the commune no longer exists as separate entity. So possible true.\n\n2887: Timo Harrikari leaving Tampere University. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n2888: Greg Matthews joins Kayseri Erciyesspor (Turkish football club). Greg Matthews is an Australian cricketer, not footballer. Unlikely. Could be another person. But improbable. Likelihood low, but possible? Could be a different Greg Matthews. But given name matches famous cricketer, unlikely to join Turkish football club. I'd mark possible false? It's not impossible for a person named Greg Matthews (different) to join. But scenario ambiguous. I'd treat as low plausibility but possible. So possible true, likelihood low.\n\n2889: Pablo Álvarez Vera leaving FC Barcelona Hoquei (roller hockey). Could be plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n2890: Jan Ptaszyn Wróblewski parting ways with Sekstet Komedy. Jan Ptaszyn Wróblewski is a Polish jazz musician (born 1931, died 1996). So impossible in 2026. So possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n2891: Torkild Brakstad - Norwegian footballer born 1945, died 2021. So impossible. possible false.\n\n2892: Herbie Jones joining R. E. Mouscron. Herbie Jones is a jazz trumpeter (1930-2001). So impossible. possible false.\n\n2893: Jana Zaumseil leaving University of Erlangen–Nuremberg. Jana Zaumseil is a real researcher (born 1975) still active. Could leave in 2026. plausible. Likelihood medium-high.\n\n2894: Sarah Vines joining Hamburger SV. Not sure who Sarah Vines is; could be a female player? Hamburger SV women's team exists. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n2895: Zaporizhzhia National University relocating from Ukraine. That would be a major relocation due to war; plausible? Could relocate to another country. Possible but unlikely. Likelihood low-medium.\n\n2885 etc.\n\n2896: Yune S Lee leaving Radboud University Nijmegen. Could be plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n2897: Javier Eraso leaving MTK Budapest FC. Javier Eraso is a Spanish footballer (born 1995) currently playing for Real Zaragoza (as of 2023). Could leave MTK Budapest if he joined earlier; plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n2898: Sona Taumalolo leaving Racing 92. Sona Taumalolo is a Tongan rugby player, currently with Racing 92 (as of 2023). Could leave in 2026. plausible. Likelihood medium-high.\n\n2899: Bronwen Astor, Viscountess Astor ending membership with Mikoyan (Russian aircraft manufacturer). Unlikely for a British aristocrat to be member of Mikoyan. Could be board? Very unlikely. Likelihood low, but possible? I'd mark impossible? Not impossible but extremely implausible. I'd set possible true? The instruction: if absolutely impossible, false. It's not absolutely impossible, but extremely unlikely. So possible true, likelihood low.\n\n2900: Zhang Yuanhe leaving Racing Club de France Football. Unknown person, plausible.

If fictional, scenario could still be plausible (a person could exist). But factual accuracy: if person is known to be alive and could be employed, plausible. If person is known to be deceased before 2026, impossible. Need quick check: Toshiyuki Tsuchiya - there is a researcher at Kyoto University? Possibly. Not sure. But plausible. Jing Zhang at iFlytek - plausible. Rémi Cilia - footballer? Actually Rémi Cilia is a French footballer born 2004, playing for AC Ajaccio? He is a defender at AC Ajaccio (as of 2023).

Rationale: Roster changes are common.\n\nNote description says \"departed on Wednesday, September 30th, 2026\" but also says October 7th, 2026 heading.

Also some mismatches like cricketer playing football club, etc. We need to output JSON with results array in same order, each with id as string, possible_in_2026 boolean, likelihood (impossible, low, medium, high), rationale (<=2 sentences).

Also a team cannot be a member of another team. So impossible.\n\n2983: Alberto Fay joins Vitória S.C. (Portuguese football club). Could be plausible if Alberto Fay is a footballer. Name plausible. No known conflict. So possible. Likelihood? Without evidence, low to medium. Probably low but possible. We'll set possible true, likelihood low, rationale: plausible transfer.\n\n2984: Aleksandr Yevstafyev departs FC Baltika Kaliningrad. Could be plausible; player leaving club. Likely possible. Likelihood medium? Since typical. We'll set possible true, likelihood medium.\n\n2985: Neil O' Brien, a cricketer, ending stint with FC Dordrecht (football club). Cricketer playing football club unlikely but possible if dual-sport. But \"renowned cricketer\" in football club improbable. Also FC Dordrecht is a Dutch football club, not cricket. Likely impossible? Could be a mistake. I'd say unlikely but not impossible; a cricketer could switch sports. So possible true, likelihood low.\n\n2986: Rigoberto Urán (Colombian cyclist) no longer a member of Max Planck Institute for Chemical Physics of Solids. He is a cyclist, not a researcher. Unlikely but could be honorary? Probably impossible. We'll set false, impossible.\n\n2987: Gunnar Kilgas joined Ludwigsfelder FC. Could be plausible; name plausible. Likelihood low-medium. We'll set true, low.\n\n2988: Robert Hall, a footballer, joins Celta de Vigo Baloncesto (basketball team). Footballer joining basketball team improbable. Could be a different person with same name. But \"Baloncesto\" is basketball. If he's a footballer, unlikely. Might be a different sport. I'd say low but possible if it's a different Robert Hall. We'll set true, low.\n\n2989: Luisa Chocarro leaves Centro De Investigación Médica Aplicada (Cima). Could be plausible researcher. Likelihood medium.\n\n2990: Anna Tarnowska leaves University of Passau. Plausible academic. Likelihood medium.\n\n2991: Leon Wiedenbacher ended his stint in NCAA Division I Men's Basketball.

The instruction: \"Base the judgment on general plausibility by 2026 (not certainty).\" So even if person is unknown, scenario could be plausible.\n\nThus likely most are possible, with varying likelihood.\n\nWe need to assign likelihood categories: impossible, low, medium, high.\n\nWe'll go through each.\n\n3001: Warren Johnson no longer member of Deportivo Alavés as of Oct 1 2026. Is there a known Warren Johnson? Not known. Could be a staff. Plausible. Likelihood: medium? Since unknown, but typical contract changes are common.

This is highly unlikely due to NCAA amateurism and age (cricketer likely professional, older). Also NCAA eligibility rules: must be amateur, not professional.

Many names may be fictional or mismatched. If impossible (e.g., person does not exist or cannot be in that role), then possible_in_2026 = false, likelihood \"impossible\". If plausible but low, etc.\n\nWe need to consider timeline: October 1 2026 is future but plausible.\n\nWe need to decide for each.\n\nLet's go through each item.\n\n3041: Otto Teplitzky with Swindon Town F.C. Is there a person named Otto Teplitzky? I don't recall. Swindon Town is an English football club. No known Otto Teplitzky. Could be fictional. Likelihood: impossible? Since no evidence of existence, but could be a staff member unknown. However, plausibility of a person with that name being employed is possible. But we need factual accuracy: Are the people, organizations, relationships realistic? If the person is not known publicly, it's still plausible they exist. The evaluation likely expects to flag unrealistic names. Many are obscure. We need to decide.\n\nGiven many names are likely fictional, but could be real individuals in lower leagues. The question: \"Base the judgment on general plausibility by 2026 (not certainty).\" So even if unknown, it's plausible that they could be members. So unless clearly impossible (e.g., a deceased person, or a person who cannot be in that role), we mark possible true.\n\nCheck each:\n\n3042: Philippa York is a real former professional cyclist (formerly Robert Millar). She is a retired cyclist, not a rider for a team. She is not a member of Crédit Agricole (team existed 1998-2008). By 2026, she would be 58, unlikely to be a rider. So impossible for her to be a member of a cycling team as a rider. Could be staff? But description says \"member of cycling team\" implying rider. So likely impossible. So possible_in_2026 false, likelihood impossible.\n\n3043: Ranko Borozan joining GAIS (Swedish football club). Ranko Borozan is a Serbian footballer born 2000, currently playing for some club. Could join GAIS in 2026 plausible. So possible true, likelihood medium maybe low? He would be 26, plausible. So possible true, likelihood medium.\n\n3044: Michael Bäckegren is a Swedish footballer currently playing for Hammarby IF (born 1995). Melbourne Victory FC (W-League) is women's league; Michael is male, cannot be in women's league. So impossible. possible false, impossible.\n\n3045: CJ de Villiers joining Palermo F.C. CJ de Villiers? Not known. Could be a player. Palermo is Italian club. Plausible. So possible true, likelihood low/medium. Probably low due to unknown.\n\n3046: Natalia Korotkova at University of Washington. Could be a professor. No known figure. Plausible. possible true, likelihood medium.\n\n3047: Orderia Mitchell at Purdue University. Unknown name, plausible. possible true, likelihood medium.\n\n3048: Jacek Szade with Japan national rugby union team. Unknown name, plausible. possible true, likelihood low-medium.\n\n3049: Thomas Kessler at Eintracht Frankfurt. Thomas Kessler is a Luxembourgish goalkeeper currently at Mainz 05 (as of 2023). Could transfer to Eintracht Frankfurt by 2026 plausible. So possible true, likelihood medium.\n\n3050: Doug Barber leaving Tampereen Pyrintö basketball team.

Unknown, plausible. possible true, likelihood low.\n\n3052: Maciej Szewczyk joining East Tennessee State Buccaneers men's basketball. Unknown, plausible. possible true, likelihood low.\n\n3053: Steven Lim leaving University of Malaya.

Bo Pan? Unknown, plausible. possible true, likelihood low.\n\n306: Saleh Al-Nu' eimeh joining Turkey national football team. Name seems Arabic, could be naturalized. Could join national team by 2026 plausible if eligible. Likelihood low-medium.\n\n3057: Jorge Garbajosa leaving BC Khimki. Jorge Garbajosa is a retired Spanish basketball player, now executive. He could be part of BC Khimki staff, but \"member\" ambiguous. He is older (born 1977), could be in management. Plausible. possible true, likelihood medium.\n\n3058: David Giler joining Avispa Fukuoka. David Giler is a film producer (died 2021). So impossible. possible false, impossible.\n\n3059: Antonín Presl leaving FC Irtysh Omsk. Unknown, plausible. possible true, likelihood low.\n\n3060: \"On October 1st, 2026, left SpVgg Greuther Fürth II\" No name given. The description missing subject. So cannot assess plausibility; ambiguous. Likely impossible to evaluate; but scenario of someone leaving is generic. Since no entity, we treat as impossible due to missing info. possible false, impossible.\n\nNow assign likelihood categories: For possible true, we need to choose among low, medium, high. High would be very likely given known facts. For many unknown names, low. For known plausible transfers, medium. For 3043 (Ranko Borozan) medium. 3049 (Thomas Kessler) medium. 3042 impossible. 3044 impossible. 306 (Saleh) low-medium maybe low. 3057 medium.\n\nNow craft rationale <=2 sentences.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nNeed id as string.\n\nLet's list results.\n\nI'll assign:\n\n3041: possible true, likelihood low (unknown person).

Rationale: Ranko Borozan is an active footballer and a move to GAIS at age 26 is plausible.\n\n3044: false, impossible. Rationale: Michael Bäckegren is a male footballer and the W-League is a women's competition, making his membership impossible.\n\n3045: true, low. Rationale: CJ de Villiers is not a known professional player, but a signing by Palermo could occur; no evidence contradicts it.\n\n3046: true, medium.

However some may be impossible: e.g., \"Bander Al-Bishi's tenure in the Premier League\" - Premier League is a soccer league; a person named Bander Al-Bishi may be a Saudi name; could be a player; plausible. \"Michael J Stock\" joining İstanbulspor - plausible. \"Jimmy Casper\" no longer member of Cycle Collstrop - Cycle Collstrop is a cycling team that disbanded? Cycle Collstrop was a Belgian cycling team that existed until 2009. So by 2026, the team no longer exists, making scenario impossible. So possible_in_2026 = false. Likelihood \"impossible\".

It has a General Assembly of members (representatives). Could be a member? Possibly as a researcher? Might be plausible but uncertain. But likely not a typical \"member\". Might be considered \"member of the DFG\" as a board member; improbable for a random researcher. We'll assign low likelihood but possible?

Likely possible, high.\n\n3085: Luke Axtell departs Jazan University Faculty of Public Health. Could be staff. Likely possible, high.\n\n3086: Vernon Turner leaves Lucchese 1905 (Italian football). Could be a player. Likely possible, medium-high.\n\n3087: Crandall Head departs NCAA Division I Men's Basketball. Could be a player leaving college. Likely possible, high.\n\n3088: William Cook leaves Appalachian State Mountaineers men's basketball. Possible, high.\n\n3089: Demond Mallet leaves Brose Bamberg.

Possible, high.\n\n3092: Carolien G De Kovel leaves Caltech. Could be a researcher. Possible, medium.\n\n3093: Bibiana A Bilbao leaves FC Midtjylland. Could be a female player?

He is a Sierra Leone striker, never played La Liga historically. Unlikely but could be a fictional scenario; but plausible that he could have been in La Liga and left.

Need to evaluate each description for plausibility by 2026.\n\nWe must consider factual accuracy: are the people real? Some may be obscure. If person is real but age would make scenario impossible (e.g., retired athlete too old). Also organizations: clubs, universities, etc. Need to judge plausibility.\n\nWe need to decide possible_in_2026: false only if absolutely impossible (e.g., person dead before 2026, or organization not existing). Otherwise true.\n\nWe also assign likelihood: impossible (if possible_in_2026 false), else low/medium/high based on plausibility.\n\nWe need concise rationale.\n\nLet's go through each item.\n\nWe need to know some of these individuals: Magdalena Janecka? Not known. Could be fictional; plausible as a player joining a lower-tier club Ashton United FC (English non-league). Date 2026-10-09 (Friday). 2026 Oct 9 is indeed a Friday? Let's check: 2026 calendar: 2026 is not leap year. Jan 1 2026 is Thursday (since 2025 Jan 1 is Wednesday? Actually 2024 is leap year, 2025 Jan 1 is Wednesday, 2026 Jan 1 is Thursday). Oct 9 2026: compute day: Oct 1 2026 is Thursday? Let's quick: Jan 1 Thu, days to Oct 1: Jan31,Feb28,Mar31,Apr30,May31,Jun30,Jul31,Aug31,Sep30 = 273 days. 273 mod7 = 0 (since 7*39=273). So Oct1 same weekday as Jan1 = Thursday. So Oct9 is Thursday+8 days = Friday. Yes Friday. So date matches.\n\nThus plausible.\n\nWe don't know if Magdalena Janecka exists; could be a fictional person, but plausible as a player. So possible_in_2026 true, likelihood maybe medium (no evidence but plausible). Provide rationale.\n\nNext 3122: Oumar Diop joining Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (research institute in Portugal). Oumar Diop is a name of a footballer (Mali). Could be a researcher? Could join as member (maybe researcher). Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3123: Inês Silva Pais parting ways with C.D. Aves (Portuguese football club). Could happen. Likelihood medium.\n\n3124: Sint-Martinuskerk (church) has left Bergeyr? A church cannot \"leave\" a location; physically moving a church building is improbable. Could be deconsecrated, but phrase \"has left\" is odd. Likelihood low but possible (if building relocated). But plausible? Might be impossible because a church is a building; can't leave. Could be a congregation moving. I'd say low plausibility but not impossible. So possible_in_2026 true, likelihood low.\n\n3125: Nektarios N Lathiotakis leaving Free University of Berlin. Could be a professor. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3126: Kazuyoshi Akiyama no longer a member of Imperial College London. Could be a researcher. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3127: Andrea Zangari joining Wynnum Wolves FC (Australian club). Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3128: Grégory Campi no longer a member of R.A.A. Louviéroise (Belgian club). Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3129: News about Pavel Rozhkov joining Alfreton Town FC. Pavel Rozhkov is a Russian footballer born 1995? Actually there is a Russian footballer Pavel Rozhkov (born 1995). In 2026 he would be 31, plausible to join a lower league club. So plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3130: Jean-Claude Pagal joining German Research Foundation (DFG). Jean-Claude Pagal is a former Cameroonian footballer born 1964, would be 62 in 2026. Joining DFG as member? DFG members are institutions, not individuals. Could be a member of the foundation board? Unlikely. So plausibility low, maybe impossible? But could be a consultant? The phrase \"joined the esteemed German Research Foundation as a member\" seems inaccurate because DFG membership is institutional. So likely impossible. So possible_in_2026 false, likelihood impossible.\n\n3131: Marco Calonaci no longer a member of A.S.D. Olimpia Colligiana (Italian club). Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3132: Kevin Ryan ended playing career in NCAA Division I Men's Basketball. Kevin Ryan is a common name; could be a player. Ending career plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3133: Edmund Saunders departure from NCAA Division I Men's Basketball. Similar. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3134: Roberta Celli tenure at Lund University ended. Could be a researcher. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3135: Sarah Johnson no longer employed at University of Sheffield. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3136: Nikica Cukrov no longer a member of SC Toulon. Nikica Cukrov is a former Yugoslav footballer born 1954, would be 72 in 2026, unlikely to be a player. Could be a staff? \"member\" ambiguous. Likely impossible for a 72-year-old to be a player. Could be a coach? But phrase \"member\" suggests player. So improbable. I'd set possible false? Might be low but not impossible if it's a staff. But given context of other items (players leaving clubs), likely a player. So I'd mark impossible.\n\n3137: David Cañas departure from La Liga. David Cañas is a Spanish footballer born 1978, would be 48 in 2026, not playing. So impossible as a player. So possible false.\n\n3138: Reinhold Adelmann no longer a member of Blau-Weiß 1890 Berlin. Not sure who he is; could be a player. Could be plausible if younger. Unknown. Likelihood medium.\n\n3139: Richard Hadlee leaving New Zealand national cricket team on Oct 12 2026. Sir Richard Hadlee born 1951, would be 75, retired long ago. Impossible. So false.\n\n3130? Already done.\n\n3140: Scott Lemoine no longer a member of Green Bay Phoenix men's basketball team, change effective Oct 14 2026. Green Bay Phoenix is NCAA Division I. Scott Lemoine unknown; could be a player. Age unknown. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nNeed id as string.

UNC Asheville Bulldogs men's basketball team. Could a player leave? Yes. So possible. Likelihood? Probably low to medium. Since unknown, but plausible. I'd say medium. Rationale: No evidence of existence, but players routinely leave teams.\n\n3142: Dajuan Wagner – there is a known basketball player Dajuan Wagner (born 1983) who played at University of Memphis (Memphis Tigers). By 2026 he'd be 43, not a college player. So being a member of Memphis Tigers men's basketball team in 2026 is implausible (college eligibility). So impossible. possible_in_2026 false, likelihood impossible.\n\n3143: Derek Smith, footballer born 1946, would be 80 in 2026. Tranmere Rovers F.C. unlikely to have an 80-year-old player. Could be a staff? But description says \"parted ways with Tranmere Rovers F.C., marking the end of his membership\". Could be a non-player role. But \"footballer\" suggests player. So impossible. possible false.\n\n3144: Bob Radley – unknown. NCAA Division I Men's Basketball player. Could be plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3145: Limbergo Taccola – unknown. S.S. Chieti Calcio is an Italian club. Could be plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3146: British Western Pacific Territories will no longer have Honiara as its capital. The British Western Pacific Territories ceased in 1976. So impossible. Also Honiara is capital of Solomon Islands, not a territory. So impossible.\n\n3147: Pratap C. Naha leaving Dublin Institute of Technology. DIT merged into Technological University Dublin in 2019. So DIT no longer exists as separate institution. So impossible (cannot leave). possible false.\n\n3148: Rivers State University severed membership ties with Association of African Universities. That's plausible; universities can leave associations. Likelihood medium.\n\n3149: Johnny Mccants leaving NCAA Division I Men's Basketball. Unknown person, plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3150: Goran Petrovic no longer a member of U.S. International Gulls Men's Basketball team. Does such team exist? \"U.S. International Gulls\" not known. Could be fictional. If fictional, scenario could still be plausible. But if team doesn't exist, impossible. Likely fictional. I'd treat as impossible because no known team. But could be a small club. However \"U.S. International Gulls\" sounds like a college? Not known. I'd mark impossible.\n\n3151: Earl Brown leaving NCAA Division I Men's Basketball. Unknown, plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3152: Herbert Kordfunke joined Stade Malherbe Caen on Oct 15 2026. Unknown person, plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3153: Sergey Merkuryev joined AFC Bournemouth on Oct 15 2026. Unknown person, plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3154: Vikrant Rai's tenure at Creighton University ended. Unknown, plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3155: Yang Feng left Darlington F.C. Yang Feng is a Chinese name; could be a player. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3156: Andrew Jackman, a notable cricketer, left Nottinghamshire Cricket Board. Could be plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3157: Cátia V Vaz joined Australia men's national soccer team. A woman joining men's national team is highly implausible (gender rules). So impossible. possible false.\n\n3158: Arianna Ozimo left A.C.F. Alessandria. A female player leaving a club is plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3159: Hans Philip leaving Ukendt Kunstner (a Danish band?). Could be plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3160: Abel E González-Vélez ended tenure at Ministry of Health and Social Protection in Colombia. Plausible.

Most are generic statements about people leaving or joining organizations. The question: \"Given an array of items, each with fields {id, description}, assess each item and output a JSON object with this exact shape...\" We need to output results array with each id, possible_in_2026 boolean, likelihood (impossible/low/medium/high), rationale.\n\nWe must evaluate factual accuracy, timeline feasibility, real-world plausibility. Since many names may be obscure or possibly not real. We need to decide if scenario is plausible. If the person is unknown, it's still plausible they could be employed at that organization. Unless the organization doesn't exist or the person is known to be impossible (e.g., deceased). We need to check quickly.\n\nLet's scan each:\n\n3161: Alexis Bohlin at Sandia National Laboratories California. Sandia has labs in New Mexico and California? Actually Sandia has a California site (SNL/CA) in Livermore. Person name plausible. No known conflict. So plausible. Likelihood: low to medium? It's a routine staff change. Likelihood of happening is medium (common). So possible_in_2026 = true, likelihood medium.\n\n3162: Micky Nutton at Millwall F.C. Millwall is a football club in England. Player named Micky Nutton? Not known. Could be a staff. Plausible. Likelihood low? Player turnover is common. So possible true, likelihood low/medium. I'd say low because unknown but plausible.\n\n3163: John Lynch at Trinity Tigers Men's Basketball (Trinity University in Texas). John Lynch is a common name. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3164: Chandrakant Holkar at Institute of Chemical Technology (Mumbai). Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3165: Carlo Pinsoglio at Cardiff University's Cardiff School Of Chemistry. Carlo Pinsoglio is a known Italian neurosurgeon (maybe not chemist). Actually Carlo Pinsoglio is a neurosurgeon, professor at University of Zurich. Unlikely to be at Cardiff School of Chemistry. So factual implausibility. Could he be there? Unlikely. So scenario improbable but not impossible? He could change field. But given his known career, improbable. Likelihood low? Might be impossible? I'd say low but possible. However we need to assess factual accuracy: the person is real but not in that field. Could be a different person with same name. So plausible. I'd set possible true, likelihood low.\n\n3166: Robin Holding Kay at Ontario Tech University. Name seems plausible. No issues. Likelihood low.\n\n3167: Carl-Johan H Södersten started working for German Research Foundation as of Oct 16 2026. Carl-Johan Södersten is a Swedish economist, maybe older. He was born 1945, would be 81 in 2026. Starting a new role at DFG at 81 is unlikely but not impossible. Likelihood low. Could be a different person. I'd set possible true, likelihood low.\n\n3168: Stefan Schärer at Pfadi Winterthur (Swiss handball club). Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3169: Rick Barbier at McNeese Cowboys basketball. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3170: Fred E Gouker at Cornell University ending Oct 17 2026. Not known. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3171: Atuheire Kipson at Musanze F.C. (Rwanda). Atuheire Kipson is a known footballer (Rwandan). He could leave. Plausible. Likelihood medium (player transfers common). So possible true, likelihood medium.\n\n3172: John Wooton at West Virginia Mountaineers men's basketball. John Wooton is a known track & field coach, not basketball. Unlikely to be on basketball team. Could be a different person. Plausible but low. I'd set possible true, likelihood low.\n\n3173: Amador M González joined German Research Foundation. Name plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3174: Guillaume Hubert left Innovation Works, Eads. Guillaume Hubert is a Belgian football goalkeeper. Not likely at Innovation Works. Could be a different person. Plausible but low. possible true, likelihood low.\n\n3175: Danilo Bürger joined CP Gijón Solimar (maybe a sports club). Name plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n316? Actually 3176: Kevin Mcgraw no longer member of Siena Saints men's basketball. Kevin McGraw is a former MLB pitcher, not basketball. Unlikely but could be different. plausible low.\n\n3177: Makrina Totsika no longer member of FK Inđija. Name seems Greek female, FK Inđija is Serbian football club (men). Unlikely female in men's team. Could be staff. Plausible low.\n\n3178: Isaac Emery joined NYU Violets men's basketball. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3179: Duane Faust no longer member of UMBC Retrievers men's basketball. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3180: Gianpiero Tozzi no longer member of Vigor Lamezia (Italian football club). Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\nAll are plausible events (staff changes). None are impossible. So possible_in_2026 = true for all. Likelihood categories: we can assign low for most, medium for some where known person in sports likely to have turnover. Maybe high for none.\n\nWe need concise rationale <=2 sentences.\n\nLet's craft JSON.\n\nWe must ensure id as string? The schema says \"id\": string. Input ids are numbers.

Many names may be fictional; but unless impossible (e.g., a person cannot be a member of a team because of age, gender, etc.) we consider possible. Also some organizations: A.C. Reggiana 1919 is a real Italian football club. Could have a player named Slobodan Simović? Possibly a Serbian name; plausible. Tenure ending is plausible.\n\nCheck each:\n\n3201: Slobodan Simović leaving A.C. Reggiana 1919 on Oct 17 2026. Plausible. Likelihood: medium (depends on contract). We'll set high? Since normal player transfers happen. Likelihood high.\n\n3202: Folly Malone ending membership with Houston Cougars men's basketball team. Folly Malone sounds female name; men's basketball team cannot have female player. Could be a staff? But says membership as player. That is implausible. So impossible? Could be a coach? But description says membership, ambiguous. Likelihood low? Since gender mismatch makes it unlikely but not impossible if it's a staff. But \"membership\" ambiguous. I'd say low plausibility. possible_in_2026 = true? It's not impossible, could be a coach. But description says \"set to end her membership with the Houston Cougars men's basketball team\". Could be a female staff member. So plausible. Likelihood low to medium. We'll set low.\n\n3203: Patrick Allen began tenure at Hapoel Kfar Saba F.C. plausible.

Likelihood high.\n\n3205: Lindsay Johnson parting ways with German Research Foundation (DFG). Could be staff; plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n3206: Kennedy Isles no longer member of Newtown United FC. Newtown United FC is a club in St. Kitts. Kennedy Isles could be a player. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n3207: Abdoulaye Sissako leaving LB Châteauroux. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n3208: Deaundra Murphy leaving Marshall Thundering Herd men's basketball team. Deaundra is female name; men's basketball team player unlikely. Could be staff. But likely improbable. We'll set low.\n\n3209: Febryan Setiawan leaving National Cheng Kung University. Plausible academic. Likelihood high.\n\n3210: Rick Mrozik start membership with OFK Beograd on Oct 17 2026. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n3211: José Kanté leaving AEK Larnaca FC. Plausible.

Likelihood high.\n\n3213: Co Hermes no longer member of UAM Iztapalapa. \"Co Hermes\" sounds like an organization, not a person. Could be a group. Unclear. Might be impossible as \"Co Hermes\" is not a person. But could be a collective. Hard to assess. Likelihood low.\n\n3214: Ana Miar parting ways with Team Metalced. Team Metalced unknown; could be e-sports. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3215: Sanitätstruppenschule Des Heeres vacated premises in Munich. This is a German army medical school. Could relocate.

Likelihood high.\n\n3217: Gert Wappler set to end membership with NCAA on Oct 19 2026. NCAA is an association, not a membership for individuals; could be a staff or official. Plausible but odd.

He is a former English footballer, born 1969, died 2022. So by 2026 he is dead. Departure from Preston North End in 2026 impossible. So possible_in_2026 false, likelihood impossible.\n\n3222: Andy Linighan, former English defender, born 1962, retired long ago, not a player. Could be staff?

I'd say possible true, likelihood low.\n\n3223: Iñigo Landaluze, Spanish cyclist born 1973, retired. Euskaltel-Euskadi team existed 1994-2013, revived later? The description says team existed 1994-2013, but departure in 2026 from a team that ceased 2013. So impossible. possible false, impossible.\n\n3224: Ishan Deshpande at Friedrich Miescher Institute. Ishan Deshpande is a real researcher? Possibly a scientist. Could be employed there and leave in 2026. Plausible. Likelihood medium-high. So possible true, likelihood medium.\n\n3225: Sirje Endre leaving Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 2026. Soviet Union dissolved 1991, party no longer exists. So impossible. possible false, impossible.\n\n3226: Pat Lawrence no longer participating in NCAA Division I Men's Basketball as of 2026. Pat Lawrence could be a player? NCAA players are limited to age, but could be a coach? The description says \"participating\". Could be a player, but unlikely at older age. If it's a player, impossible. If it's a coach, plausible.

Luma de Oliveira is Brazilian model, born 1964; Eike Batista is Brazilian businessman, born 1956. They were married? Actually they were married 1990s? I think they were married 1990s, divorced 1998. So a divorce in 2026 impossible (already divorced). So impossible.\n\n3239: João Marcos, footballer born 1953, starts membership with Vejle Boldklub in 2026 at age 73. Unlikely as player, but could be a staff? Description says \"membership\" ambiguous. But likely impossible as player. Could be a ceremonial role. But plausible? I'd say unlikely but not impossible.

Many names seem random or possibly not real. For plausibility, if the person is not known to exist, we can treat as fictional, but scenario could still be plausible (someone could be a member). However, if the organization is a sports team and the person is far older (e.g., Frank McLintock born 1941, would be 85 in 2026, unlikely to be a player but could be staff). The description says \"member\" ambiguous. For plausibility, we consider realistic possibilities.\n\nWe need to decide possible_in_2026: if scenario is not impossible (i.e., could happen).

I don't know a player by that name. Could be a student-athlete. Age? If a typical college player, would be 18-22, could be on team in 2026. So plausible. Likelihood: medium? Since unknown but plausible. possible_in_2026 true.\n\n3242: Howard Rosenfeld, Crystal Palace F.C. Not a known player. Could be staff. Could leave in 2026. Plausible. Likelihood low? Probably low because unknown. possible true.\n\n3243: Alexander K Prichard, EPFL (Swiss university). Could be a researcher or staff. Leaving in 2026 plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3244: Franco Dinelli, South Africa national soccer team. Not known. Could be coach or staff. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3245: Charles-Alexis Asselineau, Australian National University. Could be academic. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3246: Frank McLintock, Queens Park Rangers F.C. Frank McLintock is a former England footballer, now 85. He is not a member of QPR in 2026. Could be honorary? Unlikely to be \"member\". So scenario improbable. Could be impossible? He could be a consultant, but description says \"member\". Likely impossible. So possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n3247: James J Moran, Boca Juniors. Not known. Could be player? Age unknown. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3248: Luke Babbitt, NCAA Division I Men's Basketball. Luke Babbitt born 1989, would be 37 in 2026, far beyond eligibility. NCAA players must be under 5 years after high school. So impossible for him to be playing. So scenario impossible. possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n3249: Bryce Lim, University of Hong Kong. Could be staff. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3250: Gabriel Byrne, Coritiba Foot Ball Club. Gabriel Byrne is an Irish actor, not a footballer. Unlikely to be member. Could be a staff? Very unlikely. Probably impossible. But could be a namesake. However given famous actor, improbable. I'd mark impossible.\n\n3251: David Glad, The Citadel Bulldogs basketball team. Could be a player? Age unknown. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3252: Alexander Hallner, University of Gothenburg. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3253: Teddy Teuma, Red Star F.C. Teddy Teuma is a real footballer (born 1996) playing for Red Star? Actually he plays for Red Star (France) currently. He could leave in 2026. Plausible. Likelihood medium-high. We'll set medium.\n\n3254: Alexander Skrinsky joins Fabril Esporte Clube. Not known but plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3255: Wynn Forntenot, Centenary Gentlemen Basketball. Not known. Could be player? Age unknown. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3260: Antonio R. Castilla starts at University of Melbourne. Could be academic. Plausible.

Need to evaluate each description for plausibility.\n\nWe must consider factual accuracy: are the people real? Many names may be obscure or possibly fictional. If person not known, but could exist, plausible. The scenario is about employment changes on a specific date. Generally plausible unless impossible (e.g., someone dead, or organization not existing). Also timeline: November 1, 2026 is a Sunday? Let's check: 2026-11-01 is a Sunday? 2026 is not leap year. 2026-11-01 day of week: I can compute. 2026-01-01 is Thursday (since 2025-01-01 was Wednesday? Actually 2024 is leap year. 2024-01-01 Monday. 2025-01-01 Wednesday (since 2024 has 366 days, shift 2). 2026-01-01 Thursday (shift 1). Then days to Nov 1: Jan31,Feb28,Mar31,Apr30,May31,Jun30,Jul31,Aug31,Sep30,Oct31 = 304 days. 304 mod7 = 304-7*43=304-301=3. Thursday +3 = Sunday. So indeed Sunday. So date matches day.\n\nThus many statements plausible.\n\nWe need to decide likelihood: \"impossible\" if clearly impossible (e.g., person known to be dead before 2026, or organization doesn't exist). For unknown names, assume possible. Likelihood maybe \"low\" if unlikely but possible (e.g., a 70-year-old person leaving a sports team). \"medium\" for typical employment changes. \"high\" for very likely.\n\nWe'll produce for each id.\n\nLet's quickly assess each:\n\n3341: John Kazanjian - unknown. Holy Cross Crusaders men's basketball team. Could be a staff/coach. Plausible. Likelihood medium-high. We'll set possible true, likelihood medium.\n\n3342: Fynn Gutzeit - unknown, Holstein Kiel (German football club). Could be player. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3343: Pontus Forsell at Karolinska Institute. Could be researcher. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3344: John Kamara at Aris Thessaloniki F.C. Could be player. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3345: Teddy Gipson - known basketball player (born 1978). He would be 48 in 2026. Could still be on roster? Unlikely for NCAA team (Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball is college). He wouldn't be a college player at 48. So impossible for him to be a member. So possible_in_2026 false, likelihood impossible. Rationale: He is a professional player, not college student.\n\n3346: Scott K Olehnik at Technical University of Madrid. Unknown name, plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3347: Ppc Augusto at RB Leipzig. Unknown, plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3348: Gerhard Strick at 1. FC Nürnberg. Unknown, plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3349: Alessandro Antonello at University of Oregon. Unknown, plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3350: Mele French at Gitam Dental College And Hospital, Visakhapatnam. Unknown, plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3351: Ugochukwu Njoku at Golden State Warriors. Unknown, plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3352: Mike Moore set to start playing NCAA Division I Men's Basketball on Nov 1 2026. Could be a freshman. Plausible. Likelihood medium-high.\n\n3353: Jerry Lucas at King's College London. Jerry Lucas is a famous basketball player born 1940, would be 86 in 2026, unlikely to be staff? Could be emeritus professor? But Jerry Lucas is known as basketball player, not academic. Could be a different person with same name. Plausible. Likelihood low? We'll set possible true, likelihood low.\n\n3354: Project at CUNY Graduate Center starting Nov 1 2026. Plausible research project. Likelihood high.\n\n3355: Gwynne Jones welcomed as new member of Royal Society. Royal Society elects fellows; plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3356: R Nigmatullin leaving University of Ulm. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3357: Antti Puisto leaving Aalto University. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3358: Aitor Tornavaca joining Pakistan International Airlines cricket team. PIA has a cricket team historically; plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3359: Karel Stromšík departs SK Tatran Poštorná. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3360: Stjepan Bobek joins Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism at University of São Paulo. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\nNow produce JSON with id as string.\n\nWe'll assign likelihood categories: high, medium, low, impossible.\n\nFor most, medium. For 3345 impossible. For 3354 high. For 3352 medium-high? We'll choose high? It's a typical new player; likely. We'll set high. For 3355 medium. For 3341 maybe medium.

Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3445: Hiroshi Moriyasu's tenure with Sagan Tosu ended. Sagan Tosu is Japanese club. Hiroshi Moriyasu could be a player/coach. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3446: Xianguang Meng joins Club Rubio Ñu (Paraguayan club). Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3447: Joshua Kellner leaves Medical University of South Carolina. Could be a professor. Plausible. Likelihood medium (academic moves common).\n\n3448: Jiao Huang parts ways with Peking University. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3449: Olivier De Cazanove leaves University of Burgundy. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3450: Michael W. Wyatt leaves Stanford University. Could be professor. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3451: Eurico Caires joins Slovakia U21 national football team. Unlikely because national U21 squads are for players under 21, and Eurico Caires sounds Portuguese older. Could be a coach? But description says \"joined the team\" as member, likely player. Could be impossible if age >21. Without age info, assume low plausibility. Likelihood low.\n\n3452: Damien Thompson leaves Gateshead F.C. on Nov 2 2026. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3453: Lídia Cedó joins CB Canarias (basketball? club). Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3454: Leif Engqvist no longer member of Sweden national football team on Nov 2 2026. Engqvist likely retired older player; could be leaving as staff? If as player, improbable as he would be old. Likelihood low.\n\n3455: Darryl Marshall leaves Mississippi Valley State Delta Devils basketball team. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3456: Joe Mccall set to start working for FC Den Bosch on Nov 2 2026. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3457: Julia M Lappin no longer member of CR Flamengo. Could be a player; unlikely as Flamengo is top Brazilian club; foreign female? Could be staff. Plausible low.\n\n3458: Felipe Garcia-Sanchez joins FK Voždovac (Serbian club). Plausible low.\n\n3459: Mariami Rusishvili leaves International School for Advanced Studies (Italy). Plausible medium.\n\n3460: Isedera replaces Matsusaka (no org). Vague. Could be fictional. Likely impossible due to lack of context. But could be a person replacing another in a role; plausible but vague. I'd assign low but possible. However \"Isedera\" and \"Matsusaka\" could be fictional characters. Without org, ambiguous. Might be impossible to verify. I'd set possible_in_2026 = false?

Also \"Kentaro Sugimoto has parted ways with Riken\" - Riken is a research institute; a person could be researcher; plausible. \"Tärnsören has departed from Dragsfjärd, marking the end of its presence in the location\" - seems like a place leaving a location, nonsensical.

Provide JSON with results array in same order. For each, determine possible_in_2026 (true if not impossible). Likelihood categories: impossible, low, medium, high. Provide rationale <=2 sentences.\n\nWe need to assess factual accuracy: Are the people real and plausible to be in those organizations? Many names may be obscure or possibly fictional. If a person is not known to be an athlete, but could plausibly be, we can consider possible. However if the person is clearly not real (e.g., Swati D G Rayasam joining Jethro Tull, a band that hasn't had new members since 2012? Actually Jethro Tull still active with Ian Anderson; adding a new member plausible). For each, we need to decide.\n\nWe must be strict: If scenario is absolutely impossible (e.g., a person who is dead, or a club that no longer exists, or a person not an athlete but claimed as such). Let's check each.\n\nWe need knowledge up to 2025. Let's consider each:\n\n3481: Alfonso Pedraza - real Spanish footballer, born 1996, plays for Villarreal CF first team, not \"Villarreal CF C\" (which is a lower team). He is a professional, unlikely to be in C team. By 2026, he would be 30, could still be playing. Could leave Villarreal. The statement says \"no longer a member of Villarreal CF C\". If he never was in C, it's inaccurate but plausible that he could be transferred. However \"Villarreal CF C\" is a reserve team; a senior player could be demoted? Unlikely. But not impossible. Likelihood maybe low.\n\n3482: Eric Hipolito - unknown. Could be a college basketball player for New Orleans Privateers. By 2026, could graduate. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3483: Ralph Intranuovo - He is a former NHL player, born 1973, retired long ago. By 2026, he would be 53, not playing. Saying his tenure ends in 2026 is impossible because he is already retired. So impossible.\n\n3484: James D Kellner - unknown employee of Alberta Health Services. Could be plausible. No reason impossible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3485: Ryan Wilson - there is a basketball player Ryan Wilson? Could be a college player. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3486: Seth Zvi Rosenfeld - He is a screenwriter, not a footballer. Tamworth F.C. is an English lower league club. Unlikely he is a member. Could be a fictional scenario but not impossible? He could join as a player? He is not known as athlete. So improbable but not impossible? He could be a staff? The description says membership (likely player). That seems implausible. I'd set likelihood low.\n\n3487: Swati D G Rayasam joining Jethro Tull. Jethro Tull still active, could add new member. Swati Rayasam unknown but could be musician. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3488: Emil Mellegård joining Sweden national football team. I don't know a player by that name; could be a youth player. By 2026, plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3489: Michaël Guigou joining Austin Peay Governors men's basketball. Michaël Guigou is a French rugby player, not basketball. Unlikely to switch sports at professional level. By 2026, he would be 38, retired from rugby. Joining college basketball improbable (eligibility). So impossible.\n\n3490: Elżbieta Rokosz-Piejko joining CR Vasco da Gama. Name sounds Polish female; Vasco da Gama is a Brazilian men's football club. Unlikely a female player joins men's team. Could be staff? But \"member\" ambiguous. Likely impossible.\n\n3491: Ikaika Alama-Francis no longer member of Hawaii Rainbow Warriors basketball. Ikaika Alama-Francis is a former NFL player (born 1979). Not a college basketball player. By 2026, he would be 47. Unlikely. So impossible.\n\n3492: Linda Waldman no longer member of OFC Spartak Pleven (Bulgarian football club). Could be a female staff? Not typical player. Could be staff. Plausible. Likelihood low-medium. I'll set low.\n\n3493: Rania Alkahtani concluding membership with Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology in Singapore. Could be a researcher. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3494: Semih Can Akıncılar leaving FK Partizan. Name sounds Turkish, could be a player. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3495: Victor Williams no longer member of Illinois State Redbirds men's basketball. Could be a player. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3496: Neil Edwards cricketer leaving Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club. Neil Edwards is a former Welsh cricketer born 1970, retired. By 2026, he would be 56, not playing. So impossible.\n\n3497: Pierre Ruby leaving Peugeot cycling team. Pierre Ruby is a French cyclist born 1975, retired. By 2026, 51, not on team. So impossible.\n\n3498: Michael Cutright no longer member of La Crosse Catbirds. La Crosse Catbirds were a CBA team that folded in 1994. So impossible (team no longer exists). So impossible.\n\n3499: Sacha Clémence no longer member of Angers SCO. Sacha Clémence is a French footballer born 1992, could be playing. Leaving club plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3500: Cameron Carmical no longer member of Eastern Kentucky Colonels men's basketball. Unknown but plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nWe need fields: id as string (so convert numeric to string). possible_in_2026 boolean. likelihood string. rationale <=2 sentences.\n\nLet's craft.\n\nFor impossible cases, possible_in_2026 false, likelihood \"impossible\". For others, true and appropriate likelihood.\n\nAssign likelihood categories: high (very likely), medium (reasonable), low (unlikely but possible). For many plausible, maybe medium. For some high? Eg. typical college player leaving team after graduation is high. So we can assign high for 3482, 3485, 3495, 3500 maybe. Let's decide.\n\n3482: college player leaving after graduation is high. Likelihood high.\n\n3485: similar, high.\n\n3495: similar, high.\n\n3500: similar, high.\n\n3494: player leaving club is common, high.\n\n3499: player leaving club, high.\n\n3488: joining national team is less common, medium.\n\n3487: joining Jethro Tull new member plausible but not certain, medium.\n\n3493: researcher ending affiliation, high (common). So high.\n\n3491 impossible.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nMake sure array order matches input.\n\nLet's craft rationales.\n\nWill keep <=2 sentences.\n\nProceed."}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2679, "prompt_tokens": 1912, "total_tokens": 4591, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null, "kv_transfer_params": null}

But could be a real person unknown. We need to decide.\n\nLet's examine each:\n\n3521: Cristian Consonni - I don't know. Could be a researcher. University of Trento exists. Parting ways plausible. Likelihood high (common). So possible true, likelihood high.\n\n3522: Harsh Sheth joining Khazar Lankaran FK (Azerbaijani football club). Harsh Sheth is an Indian name; could be a player. Plausible but unlikely for a non-Azerbaijani? Could happen. Likelihood medium.\n\n3523: Diana Atamaint joining Niagara Purple Eagles men's basketball team as staff. Diana Atamaint is an Ecuadorian politician (former Vice President). Unlikely to be staff for US college basketball. That seems implausible. Likelihood low, but not impossible?

Likelihood high.\n\n3527: Bob Fedor joined team at Avc Aix-En-Provence. Avc Aix-En-Provence maybe a sports club in France. Bob Fedor unknown. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3528: Rolf-Dieter Dörfler's membership with 1. Göppinger SV ended. Could be a player. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3529: Günther Happich leaving Austria National Football Team. Günther Happich was an Austrian footballer who died 1995. So impossible. possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n3530: Jan C Koch tenure at Georg-August-Universität Göttingen Universitätsmedizin ended. Jan C Koch could be a researcher. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n3531: Jung Sung-hoon left Jeju United FC. Could be a player. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n3532: María De La Paz González Gutiérrez joined University of Leeds.

Unlikely but could be a different Sam Kelsall. Low but possible. Likelihood low.\n\n3534: Toru Watanabe joined Movimento Democràtego Del Pòpoło Vałensian (some weird organization). This seems fictional. Likelihood low, but not impossible? The name looks nonsense. Probably impossible. I'd set impossible.\n\n3535: Wayne Lockett departs Virginia Tech Hokies Men's Basketball. Wayne Lockett unknown. Could be a player. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3536: Anis Ben Slimane leaving Denmark national under-19 football team. Anis Ben Slimane is a Danish footballer born 2004, would be 22 in 2026, not U19. So impossible. possible false.\n\n3537: Mario Telfair no longer member of Troy Trojans men's basketball team.

Likelihood medium.\n\n3539: Jason Pearcy no longer employed at Montana State University. Could be staff. Plausible.

We need to check factual accuracy: are the people real? Many names may be obscure or possibly fictional. If a person is not known, but could exist, it's plausible. The question: \"general plausibility by 2026 (not certainty)\". So unless impossible (e.g., person dead before 2026), we consider possible. We need to assess each.\n\nLet's go through each:\n\n3561: Helen Pearce leaving GSK. Helen Pearce is a real person? There is a Helen Pearce who was a senior exec at GSK? Possibly. Even if not, plausible. Likelihood: high (normal turnover). possible true.\n\n3562: Guoqian Chen no longer a member of Saint Joseph's Hawks men's basketball team as of Nov 12 2026. Guoqian Chen? Not known, but plausible as a college player. Likelihood: medium (college players graduate). possible.\n\n3563: Mad Ball becomes a member of University of Granada. \"Mad Ball\" sounds like a band or entity, not a person. Membership of a university? Could be a student organization? \"Member of the University\" ambiguous. Likely implausible as phrasing. Could be a person named Mad Ball? Unlikely.

The scenario \"Mad Ball has officially become a member of the University of Granada\" could be plausible if Mad Ball is a person. But name seems fictional. I'd treat as low plausibility but not impossible. So possible true, likelihood low.\n\n3564: Michael Tylo departs Molde FK. Michael Tylo is an American actor (born 1948, died 2021). He cannot depart in 2026. So impossible. possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n3565: Jiří Drahoš ended tenure at Czech Academy of Sciences. Jiří Drahoš is a Czech politician, former president candidate, currently a senator. He was not a researcher at Academy. Could he have a tenure? Possibly not. But plausible he could have a role? He is alive. Could end tenure. Likelihood medium. possible true.\n\n3566: Stas Pokatilov no longer a member of FC Shakhter Karagandy. Stas Pokatilov is a Kazakh goalkeeper, born 1992, currently playing for FC Kairat (as of 2023). Could leave Shakhter Karagandy (if he was there). Plausible.

Likelihood low-medium. I'd say low.\n\n3568: Ilona Győri set to join FC Energie Cottbus. Ilona Győri? Not known, but plausible as a player. Likelihood low.\n\n3569: Tara Smith joins LB Châteauroux. Tara Smith is a common name; plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3570: Nathaniel Evans departs University of Geneva. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3571: Fabiana Ferreira De Souza parts ways with Unifran. Unifran is a Brazilian university. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3572: Takawashi joins National Oceanography Centre.

Niccolò Bartalucci is not known, but plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3576: Mike Annese's tenure in NCAA Division I Men's Basketball ended on Nov 12 2026. Mike Annese? Not known as a player; could be a coach. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3577: Giacomo Delaude no longer a member of S.S.D. Acireale Calcio 1946. Plausible.

Likelihood categories: impossible if event cannot happen (e.g., person dead before 2026). We don't have death info. So likely all possible. Likelihood: low, medium, high based on typical turnover. Departures from clubs are common; likelihood high. Appointments as staff also plausible. So assign high likelihood for most. For odd combos maybe low.\n\nWe need to output id as string, so convert numbers to strings.\n\nLet's craft each result.\n\nWe'll go through each:\n\n3601: Henrik Gustavsson leaving Åtvidabergs FF on 13 Nov 2026. Henrik Gustavsson is a Swedish former goalkeeper born 1976, retired. By 2026 he'd be 50, unlikely to be a player, but could be staff. The description says membership, not player. Could be plausible if he's staff. But if it's a player, impossible. Since not specified, plausible. Likelihood medium? I'd say low to medium. I'll set possible true, likelihood low (since unlikely for a 50-year-old to be member). Rationale: Gustavsson is retired; a 2026 departure as player unlikely but possible as staff.\n\n3602: Brad Turell no longer member of UC Santa Barbara Gauchos men's basketball team as of 13 Nov 2026. Brad Turell unknown; typical college players are 18-22, so by 2026 they'd be in that age range if born ~2004-2008. Could be plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n3603: Stéphanie Allassonnière ending tenure at École polytechnique on 13 Nov 2026. She is a French researcher, plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n3604: Elvir Melunović leaving Salgueiro Atlético Clube on 13 Nov 2026. He is a Bosnian footballer born 1999, age 27 in 2026, plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n3605: Fágner (born 1988) leaving Neuchâtel Xamax FCS on 13 Nov 2026. He would be 38, could still be playing but unlikely; could be staff. Likelihood medium.\n\n3606: Eddie Andrews starting membership with German Research Foundation on 13 Nov 2026. Could be a researcher; plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n3607: Joe Tighe leaving Iona Gaels men's basketball on 13 Nov 2026. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n3608: Mandy Glass leaving Colchester United FC on 13 Nov 2026. Not sure if female player in men's team; but could be staff. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3609: Luigi Brugnano ending tenure at University of Florence on 13 Nov 2026. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n3610: Tim Mathews leaving Alabama State Hornets basketball on 13 Nov 2026. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n3611: Dennis Meier joining Princeton Tigers men's basketball as staff on 14 Nov 2026. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n3612: Chad Schoen ending NCAA Division I men's basketball participation on 14 Nov 2026. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n3613: Walter B. Dye ending tenure at University of Nevada Reno on 14 Nov 2026. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n3614: Keith Smith, English footballer, ending stint playing in NCAA Division I men's basketball on 14 Nov 2026. This is unusual: an English footballer playing NCAA basketball. Could happen if he switched sports, but unlikely. Likelihood low.\n\n3615: Stefano Avanzini leaving Istituto Giannina Gaslini on 15 Nov 2026. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n3616: Philipp Busch leaving Free University of Berlin on 15 Nov 2026. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n3617: Joe Wilson leaving St. John's Red Storm men's basketball on 15 Nov 2026. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n3618: Andriy Mostovyi leaving FC Lviv on 16 Nov 2026. He is a Ukrainian footballer born 1988, age 38, plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3619: Ismail Diakhité leaving US Tataouine on 16 Nov 2026. He is a Mauritanian footballer born 1991, age 35, plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3620: Roslyn D Noar leaving Boyce Thompson Institute on 16 Nov 2026. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\nAll possible_in_2026 = true.\n\nNow construct JSON.\n\nNeed to ensure each object has id as string, possible_in_2026 boolean, likelihood string, rationale string <=2 sentences.\n\nLet's craft concise rationales.\n\nProceed to final."}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2285, "prompt_tokens": 1934, "total_tokens": 4219, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null, "kv_transfer_params": null}

Determine possible_in_2026 boolean, and likelihood category: impossible, low, medium, high.\n\nWe need to assess factual accuracy: are the people, organizations realistic? Many names may be obscure; but plausibility: individuals could be members of clubs/universities etc. Unless impossible (e.g., FC Akademiya Tolyatti maybe exists? Actually FC Akademiya Tolyatti is a Russian football club, but \"Ton van Engelen\" is a Dutch name; plausible he could be a member. No contradictions.\n\nCheck dates: November 16, 2026 is a Monday? Let's verify: 2026-11-16 day of week. 2026 is not leap year. Using known: 2026-01-01 is Thursday (since 2025-01-01 is Wednesday? Actually 2024 is leap year, 2024-01-01 Monday. 2025-01-01 Wednesday (since 2024 has 366 days, shift 2). 2026-01-01 Friday (shift 1). Then compute day for Nov 16. Days in months up to Oct: Jan31,Feb28,Mar31,Apr30,May31,Jun30,Jul31,Aug31,Sep30,Oct31 = 304 days. Add 15 days (since Nov 16 is day 16) => 319 days. 319 mod 7 = 4 (since 7*45=315). Starting Friday +4 = Tuesday. So Nov 16 2026 is Tuesday, not Monday. Many descriptions say Monday. That is a mismatch, but plausibility? The error may make scenario less plausible but not impossible; could be misstatement. Likelihood maybe low.\n\nAlso some organizations: \"Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wielkopolski\" - there is Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wielkopolski (Polish football club). plausible.\n\n\"Great American Conference men's basketball tournament at Firelake Arena\" - Firelake Arena maybe fictional; but could be plausible.\n\n\"Hordaland replacing Vestland\" - Hordaland and Vestland are Norwegian regions; Vestland was created merging Hordaland and Sogn og Fjordane in 2020. So Hordaland replacing Vestland is opposite of reality, impossible because Hordaland no longer exists as separate county after 2020. So that scenario is impossible.\n\nOther items: \"Aleksandr Martyoshkin departure from NCAA Division I Men's Basketball\" - NCAA is a US collegiate league; a Russian name could be a player? Could be but unlikely; but plausible.\n\n\"Sergei Zimenkov leaving FC Kairat\" - FC Kairat is a Kazakh football club; plausible.\n\n\"Hyung Bae Park joining Angoulême Charente FC\" - plausible.\n\n\"Corey Sanders joining K. Sint-Niklase S. K. E.\" - unknown club but plausible.\n\n\"Fumaça footballer born 1985 leaving NK Marsonia 1909\" - plausible.\n\nThus only impossible scenario is #3630 (Hordaland replacing Vestland). Also maybe #3636: \"Aleksandr Martyoshkin departure from NCAA Division I Men's Basketball\" - NCAA is for college players, not a league membership; could be a coach or player; but \"departure from NCAA Division I Men's Basketball\" as a league is odd but could be a player graduating. Plausible.\n\nCheck #3635: \"Steinar Raaen ... Pärnu Linnameeskond\" - Pärnu Linnameeskond is an Estonian football club; plausible.\n\nThus all others possible, but likelihood varies due to date mismatch (Monday vs Tuesday).

We'll assign:\n\n- 3621: plausible, minor date error (Monday vs Tuesday). Likelihood medium? maybe low? I'd say low because specific date mismatch reduces plausibility. But still possible that description is slightly off. I'd assign low.\n\n- 3622: same, low.\n\n- 3623: joining university on Monday Nov 16 2026 (actually Tuesday). low.\n\n- 3624: German Research Foundation (DFG) employment ending on that date. plausible, low.\n\n- 3625: marriage on Nov 16 2026. date day mismatch not relevant. marriage plausible.

Provide rationale <=2 sentences.\n\nWe need to check factual accuracy: are the people real? Many names may be fictional. If fictional, scenario could still be plausible? The instruction: \"Base the judgment on general plausibility by 2026 (not certainty).\" If the person is fictional, we cannot verify, but scenario of them leaving organization is plausible. However factual accuracy: Are the people, organizations, relationships realistic? If the person is not known, but could exist, it's plausible. If organization doesn't exist (e.g., FC Leningradets Gatchina? Might be a real club? Leningradets is a club in St. Petersburg, but Gatchina? Not sure). But we can treat as plausible unless clearly impossible (e.g., \"Direction Italy\" maybe a political party? Could exist). So likely all are possible.\n\nWe need to assign likelihood: Since these are routine membership changes, likelihood is high (i.e., likely to happen). But some may be less plausible due to date specifics (e.g., \"Livio Puccioni's tenure in La Liga has come to an end\" - if he is not a known La Liga player, but could be a lower-tier?

Many names seem obscure or possibly fictional. If person is unknown, could still be plausible they join a club. But some entries have impossible details: e.g., Christine Reid was member from 1974-1988, and in 2026 she would be quite old (assuming she was at least 18 in 1974, she'd be ~70+). Could still be a member? She would be 70+, but being a player? The description says \"member of San Jose Earthquakes\", likely a player, but age unrealistic. So impossible.\n\nAlso \"James P. O' Callaghan\" with apostrophe space? Could be plausible. EPA employee leaving is plausible.\n\nCheck clubs: West Bromwich Albion FC is a football club; they could hire staff, but \"joined as a new member\" ambiguous. Could be player. Giovanni Trapletti - unknown, but could be plausible.\n\nDates: 2026-11-19 is a Thursday? Let's verify: 2026-11-19 day of week. 2026 is not a leap year (2024 leap, 2025 normal, 2026 normal). Use known: 2026-01-01 is Thursday? Actually 2025-01-01 is Wednesday (2024 leap year adds 2 days). 2024-01-01 Monday, 2024 leap adds 2 days => 2025-01-01 Wednesday, 2025 normal adds 1 => 2026-01-01 Thursday. So 2026-11-19: compute days offset from Jan 1. Days in months up to Oct: Jan31,Feb28,Mar31,Apr30,May31,Jun30,Jul31,Aug31,Sep30,Oct31 = 304 days. Add 18 days (since Jan1 is day 1). Total offset = 304+18 = 322 days. 322 mod 7 = 322 - 7*46=322-322=0. So same weekday as Jan1, which is Thursday. So Thursday matches.

Likelihood: low to medium? Since unknown, but possible. I'd say low (since no evidence). Provide rationale.\n\n3662: Stéphane Servais joins France U-17 national team as member on 2026-11-19. U-17 players are under 17; Servais likely a youth player; plausible. Likelihood: medium (common). Provide rationale.\n\n3663: Laith Nobari leaves Persepolis FC on 2026-11-19. Could be plausible. Likelihood: medium.\n\n3664: Anfernee Hampton leaves Southern Miss Golden Eagles basketball team on 2026-11-19. Could be a college player; plausible. Likelihood: medium.\n\n3665: James P. O' Callaghan leaves EPA employment on 2026-11-19. Plausible. Likelihood: medium.\n\n3666: Jon Akin leaves Atlanta Silverbacks FC on 2026-11-19. Atlanta Silverbacks currently not in top tier; plausible. Likelihood: medium.\n\n3667: Alessandro Peloni departs University of Glasgow on 2026-11-19, but description says Wednesday 2026-11-25 then says ended on Thursday 2026-11-19, six days ago as of current date. Inconsistent dates (Wednesday vs Thursday). Also \"University of Glasgow\" staff leaving plausible, but date inconsistency may make scenario questionable but still possible if error. Likelihood: low due to inconsistency.\n\n3668: Woo-Jung Choi joins A.C. Reggiana 1919 on 2026-11-19. Plausible. Likelihood: low-medium.\n\n3669: Dave Zeigler will no longer be a member of German Research Foundation as of 2026-11-19, announced Tuesday 2026-11-17. Plausible. Likelihood: low.\n\n3670: Giorgos Theodoridis set to start as member of Agritubel on 2026-11-19. Agritubel is a former French cycling team (defunct). Actually Agritubel was a professional cycling team that folded in 2009. So joining a defunct organization impossible. So impossible.\n\n3671: Alexander Nordhoff set to leave Quantec-Indeland on 2026-11-19. Quantec-Indeland unknown; could be a company. Plausible. Likelihood: low.\n\n3672: Kazuhiko Tanabe leaves Tokyo Musashino City FC on 2026-11-19. Plausible. Likelihood: medium.\n\n3673: Bruno Arfib parts ways with Pierre and Marie Curie University on 2026-11-19. University exists (Sorbonne). Plausible.

She would be at least in her 60s/70s; being a member (player) impossible. Could be staff? But description implies player. Likelihood: impossible.\n\n3675: Annie Proulx starts work for Viborg FF on 2026-11-19. Annie Proulx is a famous author, unlikely to join football club. Could be a staff role? Unlikely. Likely impossible. We'll mark impossible.\n\n3676: New member joins Blau-Weiß 1890 Berlin on 2026-11-19. Plausible. Likelihood: low.\n\n3677: Curtis Woodhouse joins Fortuna Düsseldorf on 2026-11-19. Curtis Woodhouse is a former footballer turned boxer, currently older (born 1976). In 2026 he'd be 50, unlikely to join as player but could be staff. Description says member, ambiguous. Could be plausible as staff. Likelihood: low.\n\n3678: Gilbert Armstrong will no longer be a member of Delaware State Hornets men's basketball team as of 2026-11-19. Could be a player; plausible. Likelihood: medium.\n\n3679: Jan Kadlec set to start with Niki Volos F.C. on 2026-11-19. Plausible. Likelihood: medium.\n\n3680: Xavier Hernández-Yagüe joins SK Brann on 2026-11-19. Plausible.

Also \"Jim Edmondson departure from NCAA Division I Men's Basketball\" - could be a coach, plausible. \"Jaroslav Plachý no longer member of Christian Democratic Party\" plausible. \"Aleksandr Nadiradze joining 1.

Provide rationale.\n\nWe need to quickly assess each.\n\nWe have many items.\n\nWe need to know if the person exists and plausible to be member of that organization in 2026.\n\nLet's go through.\n\n3781: Jahongir Ergashev. I know a Tajik footballer named Jahongir Ergashev (born 1994) who plays for FK Khujand? He is a footballer. Could leave club in 2026. Plausible. Likelihood: medium-high. So possible true, likelihood high? Since normal transfers happen. I'd say high.\n\n3782: Heather Mode, Kraft Foods. I don't know a person. Could be employee. No reason impossible. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3783: Charlotte Broughton, FC Hansa Rostock. Not known. Could be player or staff. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3784: Margaret Benn, Viscountess Stansgate, joins FC Stavropolye-2009. Margaret Benn is a British peer? Viscountess Stansgate is a title held by the wife of the Viscount Stansgate (e.g., Harriet Benn?). Actually the title is held by the wife of the Viscount. Not typical to join a Russian lower-tier football club. Very unlikely. Also she would be older (maybe 50+). Could be improbable but not impossible? Likelihood low. possible true? It's extremely unlikely but not impossible. So possible_in_2026 = true, likelihood low.\n\n3785: John Dove joins West Bromwich Albion F.C. John Dove is generic name; could be player or staff. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3786: Thom Evans joins CD Leganés. Thom Evans is a former Scottish rugby player turned TV presenter, born 1985. He is not a footballer. Joining a Spanish football club as member (player) unlikely. Could be staff? But \"member\" ambiguous. Still improbable. Likelihood low.\n\n3787: Andy Watson, footballer born 1978, joins S.C. Olhanense. He is a former Scottish footballer. At age 48 in 2026, could be coach. Joining as member plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3788: Rod Mcreynolds no longer member of Jacksonville State Gamecocks men's basketball team. Not known. Could be a player; but likely older? Could be staff. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3789: Miriam Olid leaves University of Barcelona. Could be professor. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3790: Billy Price, footballer born 1934, sever ties with Tsinghua University. He would be 92 in 2026. Unlikely to be affiliated. Likelihood low, but possible if honorary. I'd say low.\n\n3791: Baofu Ding leaves Berwick Rangers F.C. Not known. Could be player. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3792: Beatriz González joins Burton Albion F.C. Could be player (common name). Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3793: Stephanie J W Shoop-Worrall leaves Yale School of Public Health. Could be researcher. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3794: Shin Soo-jin leaves Ulsan Hyundai Mipo Dockyard FC. Could be player. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3795: Gavin Hickie joins Rangers F.C. Gavin Hickie is a rugby coach, not football. Unlikely to join Rangers (football) as member. Could be staff? Unlikely. Likelihood low.\n\n3796: James White leaves University of Ottawa. Could be professor. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3797: Dasan Robinson joins Secteur Ä. Secteur Ä is a French hip hop group (maybe). Dasan Robinson unknown. Could be member of a music group. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3798: Deanne Bird leaves Macquarie University Faculty of Science and Engineering. Could be professor. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3799: Oreste Roccasecca leaves S.S. Chieti Calcio. Not known. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3800: Jeroen Rouwkema joins Bohemian F.C. Jeroen Rouwkema is a Dutch architect, not footballer. Unlikely to join football club as player. Could be staff? Unlikely. Likelihood low.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nNeed id as string.

Need to evaluate each description for plausibility.\n\nWe must consider factual accuracy: many names may be real but some are unlikely (e.g., FC Tambov was dissolved in 2020; by 2026 it may not exist). Also some people are retired or deceased (e.g., Michel Vorm retired, but could be staff? He is a former goalkeeper, unlikely to be a player in 2026). Also some parties like Polish United Workers' Party dissolved in 1990; impossible for someone to be member in 2026. Also some ages: Neil Robinson born 1957 would be 69 in 2026; unlikely to be playing for KM Torhout (a lower division club). So likely impossible.\n\nWe need to decide possible_in_2026: true if not absolutely impossible. Likelihood: if possible but low, medium, high.\n\nWe need to evaluate each of 20 items.\n\nLet's go through:\n\n3801: Maksim Losel? Actually \"Maksim Losev\" - I don't know a footballer with that name. FC Tambov was dissolved in 2020. So being a member in 2026 is impossible because club doesn't exist. So possible_in_2026 = false, likelihood \"impossible\". Rationale: FC Tambov ceased operations in 2020, so cannot have a member in 2026.\n\n3802: Lisa Trigg joining HNK Hajduk Split. I don't know a player named Lisa Trigg; Hajduk Split is a men's club; women's team maybe? Could be a staff. But plausible? Could be a female player joining women's team? Not impossible. Likelihood maybe low to medium. Since no known person, but plausible that a person could join. So possible_in_2026 = true, likelihood \"low\". Rationale: No known record of Lisa Trigg as a professional footballer, but a new signing is not impossible.\n\n3803: Kurtis Paige collegiate basketball career ends as of Nov 27 2026. Assuming he is a college player now (2023?), by 2026 he could graduate. So plausible. Likelihood \"high\". possible true.\n\n3804: Olivier Chaplain joins Norway U21 football team on Nov 27 2026. Need to consider age: U21 players must be under 21 at start of competition (usually). In 2026, to be eligible, born 2005 or later. If Olivier Chaplain is a known player? Not known. Could be plausible. Likelihood medium. possible true.\n\n3805: Chieffy Caligdong parts ways with Philippines national football team on Nov 28 2026. Caligdong is a former player, born 1982, retired. By 2026 he would be 44, unlikely still a member. So impossible. possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n3806: Haider Raza joins FK BASK on Nov 28 2026. FK BASK is a Serbian club (lower division). Haider Raza unknown. Could be plausible. Likelihood low. possible true.\n\n3807: James Gamble departs NCAA Division I Men's Basketball on Nov 28 2026. Could be a college player graduating. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n3808: Nick Archer, cricketer, parts ways with Staffordshire County Cricket Club on Nov 28 2026. Could be plausible. Likelihood medium-high. possible true.\n\n3809: T O' Brien no longer member of Boston College Eagles men's basketball team on Nov 28 2026. Could be a college player graduating. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n3810: Brian Jung no longer member of Arizona Wildcats men's basketball team on Nov 28 2026. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n3811: Ihab K. Mohamed joins Andover F.C. on Nov 28 2026. Andover FC is a lower league English club. Could be plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3812: Darci Menezes no longer member of São José Esporte Clube on Nov 28 2026. Darci Menezes maybe a female? São José is a Brazilian club (women's). Could be plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3813: Bogusław Wolniewicz no longer member of Polish United Workers' Party on Nov 28 2026. The party dissolved 1990; also Bogusław Wolniewicz (philosopher) died 2017. So impossible. possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n3814: Christian Jakobsen part ways with FC Roskilde on Nov 28 2026. Christian Jakobsen is a Danish footballer born 1993, would be 33 in 2026, could still be playing. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3815: Michel Vorm's tenure with Swansea City A.F.C. ends on Nov 28 2026. Michel Vorm retired in 2020, now 38 in 2026. Unlikely to be a player. Could be a staff? But description says member (player). Likely impossible. possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n3816: Marco Piga ending membership with Associazione Sportiva Dilettantistica Ilvamaddalena on Nov 28 2026. Unknown person, club is amateur. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3817: Neil Robinson (born 1957) parts ways with KM Torhout on Nov 28 2026. He would be 69, unlikely to be a player. Could be a coach? But description says member (player). Likely impossible. possible false.\n\n3818: Gino Maes no longer member of Darlington F.C. on Nov 28 2026. Gino Maes is a former Welsh goalkeeper born 1959, retired. By 2026 he would be 67. Unlikely as player. So impossible.\n\n3819: Colin de Grandhomme ending membership with New Zealand national cricket team on Nov 29 2026. He was born 1986, would be 40. Could still be playing? He retired from international cricket in 2022. So ending membership in 2026 is impossible because already not a member. But could be a formal retirement? He already retired. So scenario stating ending membership in future is inaccurate. Likelihood impossible.\n\n3820: Machel Millwood part ways with Atlanta Silverbacks FC on Nov 30 2026. Machel Millwood is a former USL player born 1979, retired. By 2026 he would be 47. Unlikely. So impossible.\n\nNow assign likelihood categories: For possible true, we need to choose low, medium, high.\n\nDefine: high = very plausible, typical career timeline. medium = plausible but some uncertainty. low = unlikely but not impossible.\n\nLet's assign:\n\n3802 low\n3803 high\n3804 medium\n3806 low\n3807 high\n3808 medium\n3809 high\n3810 high\n3811 low\n3812 medium\n3814 medium\n3816 low\n\nNow produce JSON with id as string (so convert numbers to strings).

For plausibility, if person is real and scenario plausible (e.g., leaving a team) then possible_in_2026 = true, likelihood maybe low/medium/high. If impossible (e.g., a band joining a football club) likely impossible. Also age issues: Roddy McKenzie born 1945 would be 81 in 2026, unlikely to be playing for Clydebank FC. So impossible.\n\nWe need to assess each.\n\nLet's go through each id.\n\n3821: Rhian Brewster is a professional footballer (English striker). He is not known to be a member of Moscow State University. The description says he is no longer a member of Moscow State University. Could he have been a member (e.g., student) and left? It's plausible he could have enrolled in a university program abroad, but unlikely for a professional footballer to be a member of a Russian university. However not impossible. So possible_in_2026 = true. Likelihood maybe low (unlikely). Rationale: No evidence Brewster attended MSU, but possible he could have been enrolled and left.\n\n3822: Kojo Mensah no longer a member of Duquesne Dukes men's basketball team. Duquesne University is in Pittsburgh. Kojo Mensah is a Ghanaian basketball player who played for Duquesne? I think there is a player named Kojo Mensah who played for Duquesne (maybe). So plausible he could leave the team. Likelihood medium. Rationale: plausible roster change.\n\n3823: Kate Williamson joined England U18 football team. Kate Williamson is a name; not known as a footballer. Could be a young female player? England U18 is women's? Actually England U18 men's? Usually U18 is youth male. Kate is female name, could be women's U18. But no known player. Could be fictional. Likelihood low but possible. We'll set possible true, likelihood low.\n\n3824: Ottavio Bugatti's stint in La Liga ended. Ottavio Bugatti is not a known footballer; maybe a fictional name. Could be a player in La Liga, plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n3825: Saumik Dey joined German Research Foundation (DFG). Saumik Dey is a researcher? Could be plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3826: Aleksandr Bakhtin's tenure with Club Deportivo Universidad Católica ended. Aleksandr Bakhtin is a Russian name; could be a staff or player. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3827: Yohei Sato's tenure with Júbilo Iwata ended. Yohei Sato is a Japanese former goalkeeper, retired long ago (born 1972). By 2026 he'd be 54, unlikely still a player. Could be a staff? But description says tenure with team ended, could be as a staff. But plausible? Might be impossible as player. Since not specified role, could be staff. Likely possible. Likelihood low-medium.\n\n3828: Marco Mularoni joins Philippines National Football Team. Marco Mularoni is a Swiss tennis player, not footballer. Unlikely to join Philippines football. Could be naturalized? Very unlikely. Likelihood low, but possible? Probably impossible due to sport mismatch. I'd set possible false? But could be a dual-sport athlete? Very unlikely. I'd mark impossible.\n\n3829: Immortal (band) becomes member of Southampton F.C. A band joining a football club as member is nonsense. Impossible. possible false.\n\n3830: Roddy McKenzie born 1945, footballer? Actually Roddy McKenzie is a Northern Irish goalkeeper born 1995. But description says born 1945, which is wrong. Also Clydebank FC is a lower league Scottish club. A 81-year-old playing is impossible. So impossible.\n\n3831: Da' Shawn Phillip no longer a member of Maryland Eastern Shore Hawks men's basketball team. Could be a player. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3832: Peta Verco left Australia national cricket team. Peta Verco is a former Australian women's cricketer born 1956, retired long ago. By 2026 she would be 70, not a player. Could be a coach? Not indicated. Likely impossible as player. So impossible.\n\n3833: Shakespear Mudombi's membership with Global Young Academy ended. Global Young Academy members are early-career scientists, age limit ~35. Shakespear Mudombi unknown. Could be plausible. Likelihood low-medium.\n\n3834: Mathieu Jeannin's tenure at Institut Néel ended. Could be a researcher. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3835: Michael Moore left McGill University. Michael Moore is a common name; could be a staff. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3836: Dan Oberbrunner joined Alloa Athletic FC. Could be a player. Not known but plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3837: Oleksiy Moyseyenko left FC Milsami Orhei. Could be a Ukrainian player. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3838: John Engles became member of University of Turin. Could be a professor. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3839: Derek Bryant left Little Rock Trojans men's basketball team. Could be a player. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3840: Eloy Teruel established home in Dragsfjärd. Eloy Teruel is a Spanish motorcycle racer, could move residence. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\nNow assign likelihood categories: \"impossible\", \"low\", \"medium\", \"high\". For plausible but common roster changes maybe medium.

Many are about individuals joining/leaving organizations. Need to assess factual accuracy: are these real people? Some are obscure. If person likely exists? For plausibility, we consider if scenario possible: e.g., Ibrahim Kargbo (real footballer) joining FC Sputnik Rechitsa (Belarus club). Is that plausible? He is Sierra Leone player, age ~38 now (born 1982). By 2026 he'll be 44, could still join lower league maybe as player? Could be plausible but unlikely. But not impossible. So possible_in_2026 = true, likelihood maybe low.\n\nWe need to decide for each.\n\nWe must be concise (<=2 sentences) rationale.\n\nLet's go through each id.\n\n3841: Ibrahim Kargbo joins FC Sputnik Rechitsa Dec 1 2026. Real person, club existed but dissolved? Sputnik Rechitsa was a Belarusian club that withdrew in 2022? Actually FC Sputnik Rechitsa existed but dissolved due to financial issues. By 2026 likely not existing. So scenario impossible if club no longer exists. Could be reformed? Uncertain. Likelihood low to impossible. I'd say impossible because club dissolved. So possible_in_2026 false, likelihood \"impossible\". Rationale: FC Sputnik Rechitsa ceased operations in 2022 and no indication of revival by 2026.\n\n3842: Rubén Epitié leaves Jerez Industrial CF Dec 1 2026. Rubén Epitié is a former footballer born 1983, retired. Jerez Industrial CF is a Spanish lower division club still existing. Could he be a staff? Unlikely but possible. Not impossible. Likelihood low. possible true.\n\n3843: Zhiping Liu no longer employed at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Dec 1 2026. Zhiping Liu could be a researcher; employment changes plausible. No reason impossible. Likelihood medium (common). possible true.\n\n3844: Motoyuki Nakao leaves Kurume University Dec 1 2026. Could be professor; plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3845: Gunder Heimlich joins Pratt & Whitney Dec 1 2026. Name sounds fictional; but could be real person. No evidence. Could be plausible hiring.

Unlikely. Probably impossible. possible false.\n\n3847: Jordan Minor parts ways with Merrimack Warriors men's basketball team Dec 1 2026. Jordan Minor is a real player (born 2002) currently at Merrimack. By 2026 he'll be 24, could still be on team or graduate. Leaving plausible.

Vladimír Kováč is a Slovak basketball player born 1992, could join Dutch team. Plausible medium.\n\n3858: Rosario Rodriguez leaves Sopela Women's Team Dec 1 2026. Could be player; plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n3859: J. Ritchie Patterson joins Al Wasl F.C. Dec 1 2026. J. Ritchie Patterson is a physicist, not footballer. Unlikely.

Some are obscure; likely not known, so plausible. Some like \"Ezequiel Castillo\" - is there a professional footballer with that name? Not sure. Could be plausible. \"Hernán Gaviria\" - there is a Colombian footballer Hernán Gaviria (born 1969) who died in 2002. So a scenario of him being with Deportivo Cali in 2026 is impossible (dead). So possible_in_2026 = false, likelihood impossible.\n\n\"Marina Hegering\" is a German women's footballer, currently playing for Juventus (as of 2023).

But scenario could be improbable but not impossible? She could retire and join staff? But description says member of organization, ambiguous. I'd set possible true but low.\n\n\"Nina C Flerin\" - unknown; could be plausible.\n\n\"Lucio Ianiero\" unknown.\n\n\"Tom Parks\" joining Raja CA (Moroccan club) plausible.\n\n\"Costel Câmpeanu\" - there is a Romanian footballer Costel Câmpeanu born 1965, likely retired.

Possibly also \"Marina Hegering\" joining Vicenza Calcio women's side? But still possible. We'll assign low likelihood for that.\n\nAlso need likelihood categories: if possible true but low chance, \"low\". If plausible normal, \"medium\" or \"high\".

He was UN Secretary-General? He served as UN Secretary-General? He was UN Secretary-General? Actually Tokayev was UN Secretary-General? He served as UN Secretary-General? He was UN Secretary-General? I think he was UN Secretary-General? No, Tokayev served as Chairman of the Senate, etc. He was not UN staff. He is President of Kazakhstan. Could he have a tenure with UN? He was UN Secretary-General? Not. So \"ended his tenure with the United Nations\" is implausible because he never had a tenure.

Rugby union player being with a football club is unlikely. Could be a mistake. So improbable. Could be impossible? Not impossible if he was maybe a dual-sport or staff, but description says rugby union player. Likelihood low. possible true.\n\n3924: Giselle Sandi leaving Argonne National Laboratory.

Need to evaluate each description for plausibility by 2026.\n\nWe must assess factual accuracy: are the people real? Some names may be fictional. If a person is clearly impossible (e.g., John Dohner? unknown) but could be a real person, we treat as plausible. If a person is known to be deceased before 2026 (e.g., John Burke born 1948, rugby league player maybe still alive at 78, could still be member? but being a player at 78 improbable). However scenario is \"parted ways\" meaning leaving team, could be plausible as a staff? But described as \"renowned rugby league player born 1948\". At age 78, unlikely to be playing, but could be a ceremonial role. Likelihood low but possible.\n\nCheck dates: December 1, 2026 is a Tuesday? Let's verify: 2026-12-01 day of week. 2026 is not leap year (2024 leap, 2025 not, 2026 not). Using known reference: 2025-12-01 is Monday? Actually 2025-12-01 is Monday (I think). Then 2026-12-01 would be Tuesday. So day matches.\n\nWe need to evaluate each scenario: joining or leaving organizations. Generally plausible unless contradictory (e.g., \"Keith Chegwin\" is a British TV presenter who died 2017, cannot join in 2026). So that is impossible. Also \"Jim McIntyre\" is a Scottish football manager born 1972, could be in national B team? He is a manager, not player. But scenario says \"renowned footballer\". Could be plausible but maybe not. But not impossible.\n\n\"Eliane Giardini\" is a Brazilian actress, not footballer. So impossible.\n\n\"Stefanie Karg\" maybe a volleyball player? VK Prostějov is a Czech volleyball club. Could be plausible.\n\n\"Keith Chegwin\" died 2017, impossible.\n\n\"John Burke\" rugby league player born 1948, could be alive but unlikely to be playing; but scenario says \"renowned rugby league player\". Could be a veteran, but still plausible that he was a member (maybe as a coach). Not impossible.\n\n\"Don Kaull\" unknown.\n\n\"Sidney Gates\" unknown.\n\n\"Yukhym Konoplya\" is a Ukrainian footballer (defender) born 1999, currently playing for Shakhtar Donetsk, not North Carolina Tar Heels basketball. So impossible.\n\n\"Ralf Reulke\" unknown.\n\n\"Marko Čolaković\" unknown.\n\n\"Adam Boethius\" unknown.\n\n\"Paula Espinal\" unknown but could be researcher.\n\n\"Peter Houweling\" unknown.\n\n\"Marin Andrei\" unknown.\n\n\"Mladen Filipan\" unknown.\n\n\"Aleksejs Volosanovs\" unknown.\n\n\"Anthony Gorman\" unknown.\n\n\"Keith Chegwin\" impossible.\n\n\"Joel Hawkes\" unknown.\n\nWe must assign likelihood: if plausible but uncertain, maybe \"low\" or \"medium\". For generic unknown individuals joining institutions, plausible. So likely \"high\" for generic plausible events? The scenario is just a staff change; unless contradictory, it's plausible.

However description says \"renowned rugby league player\". Could be still affiliated as ambassador. Plausible but low. So possible true, likelihood low.\n\n3949: Jim McIntyre no longer member of Scotland national football B team. Jim McIntyre is a manager, not player, but could be a coach. Description says \"renowned footballer\". Might be inaccurate but could be plausible as a staff. Likelihood medium maybe. possible true.\n\n3950: Sidney Gates leaving FC Desna Chernihiv. Plausible. high.\n\n3951: Yukhym Konoplya leaving North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball. Yukhym Konoplya is Ukrainian footballer, not basketball. Impossible. So possible false, likelihood impossible.\n\n3952: Ralf Reulke joining University of Illinois Chicago. Plausible. high.\n\n3953: Marin Andrei leaving Valencia CF.

If person is real but age would make scenario impossible (e.g., retired long ago). Let's check.\n\nList:\n\n3961: María-Luisa De La Cruz joining SK Kladno (Czech hockey? Actually SK Kladno is a Czech ice hockey club). María-Luisa De La Cruz? Not known. Could be a fictional name. Not impossible for a player to join a club. Likelihood low to medium. Probably possible.\n\n3962: Yossi Benayoun (real Israeli footballer, born 1980). By 2026 he would be 46. He retired already. Could he be a member of Maccabi Haifa? He played there earlier. Could be a staff role? The description says tenure ended. Could happen if he was a staff member. Possible but unlikely. Likelihood low.\n\n3963: Ricardo A Pizarro (maybe Ricardo Pizarro? Not known).

Darko Djukić is a real former player (born 1977). By 2026 age 49, could be staff. Leaving plausible.\n\n3967: Clive Platt (real English footballer, born 1977). He retired long ago. \"Departure from Premier League\" as a player impossible. Could be as a staff? But phrase suggests as a player. By 2026 he would be 49, not playing. So impossible as player. Likelihood impossible.\n\n3968: Stefan Zimmer at Humboldt University of Berlin. Could be a professor. No known person. Possible.\n\n3969: Palani R Jothi at National Institute for Materials Science (Japan). Could be researcher. Possible.\n\n3970: Daniel Brückner (real German footballer, born 1985).

Need to evaluate each description for plausibility. Most are simple membership changes; plausible. Need to consider if any impossible: e.g., \"Shi Zhengli is no longer a member of S. S. D. Jesina Calcio\" – Shi Zhengli is a virologist, not a football player; unlikely but not impossible? Could be a different person with same name; but likely implausible. However we treat plausibility: could a virologist be a member of an Italian football club? Membership could be as a player? Unlikely. But could be a staff? Probably impossible. So mark possible_in_2026 false, likelihood \"impossible\". Others: \"Jack Stumborg has joined the UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball team\" - plausible if he's a player. No known person; plausible. \"Bill Rehder is no longer a member of the Washington State Cougars men's basketball team\" plausible. \"Emiko Shishido joined Ohio Bobcats men's basketball team\" plausible (female joining men's team? unlikely). Could be women's team? It's men's, so improbable but maybe as a coach?

For plausibility, we can note if day-of-week mismatches. Let's quickly check: 2026 is not a leap year? 2024 leap, 2025 not, 2026 not. Calendar: Jan 1 2026 is Thursday? Actually 2025 Jan 1 is Wednesday (2024 leap adds 2 days). 2024 Jan 1 Monday, 2024 leap year adds 2 days to 2025 Jan 1 = Wednesday. 2025 not leap adds 1 day to 2026 Jan 1 = Thursday. So Jan 1 2026 Thursday. Compute day of week for Dec 8 2026. Days in months: Jan31, Feb28, Mar31, Apr30, May31, Jun30, Jul31, Aug31, Sep30, Oct31, Nov30, Dec? Sum up to Nov 30: 31+28+31+30+31+30+31+31+30+31+30 = 334 days. Dec 8 is 8 days into Dec, so total days from Jan1 to Dec8 = 334 + 7 (since Jan1 is day 0) = 341? Actually Jan1 is day 0, Jan2 day1... easier: compute day of week: Jan1 Thursday. Add 341 days mod7. 341 mod7 = 5 (since 7*48=336, remainder5). Thursday +5 = Tuesday. So Dec8 2026 is Tuesday. Good matches many descriptions (Tuesday). Dec9 2026: add 1 day => Wednesday. Dec10 2026: Thursday. Dec12 2026: Saturday. Dec13 2026: Sunday. So day-of-week matches given in many.

If plausible but unlikely, low/medium/high.\n\nWe must output JSON with \"results\" array preserving order.\n\nWe need to quickly evaluate each.\n\nLet's go through each id.\n\n4001: Giovanni Perissinotto, Udinese Calcio. I don't know such person. Udinese is Italian football club. No known figure named Giovanni Perissinotto. Could be a staff member unknown. Could be plausible that a staff member leaves. No impossibility. Likelihood low? Probably low because unknown but possible. So possible_in_2026 = true, likelihood low.\n\n4002: Hédi Berkhissa joined Port Vale FC. Hédi Berkhissa was a Tunisian footballer who died in 1997. So impossible for him to join in 2026. So possible_in_2026 false, likelihood impossible.\n\n4003: Beatriz Calvo-Merino left City, University of London. Beatriz Calvo-Merino is a known neuroscientist, currently at University College London? Actually she is at University College London (UCL). She is a real researcher. Could she have been at City University? Possibly not but plausible she could have been there and left. Not impossible. Likelihood medium.\n\n4004: Tom Hogan departs Wagner Seahawks men's basketball team. Wagner College is a real NCAA team. Tom Hogan could be a player or staff; unknown but plausible. So possible true, likelihood low/medium. Probably low.\n\n4005: Greg Pierce no longer member of Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks (NRL). Greg Pierce is a former Australian rugby league player, died 2022? Actually Greg Pierce (born 1949) died 2022. So impossible. So false, impossible.\n\n4006: Joseph Boylan no longer member of Lafayette Leopards men's basketball team as of Dec 15 2026 (future). Joseph Boylan is a basketball coach, born 1948, currently retired? He coached at Lafayette previously (1990s). He could still be a member? At age ~78, unlikely but possible as a consultant. But scenario says \"will no longer be a member as of tomorrow\". Could be plausible if he's still on staff. Not impossible. Likelihood low.\n\n4007: Taekyung Lee departs Northwestern University. Not sure who this is; could be a student or staff. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n4008: Paul Thompson (footballer born 1973) no longer member of Blyth Spartans AFC as of Dec 15 2026. Paul Thompson is a former English footballer, retired long ago. At age 53, could be a coach or staff. Could be plausible. Not impossible. Likelihood low.\n\n4009: Gopal Chawla part ways with Croatia national football team. Gopal Chawla is a name not known in football; could be a coach? Unlikely but possible. However Croatia national team staff are known; no Gopal Chawla. Could be fictional. Likelihood low but possible. I'd set possible true, likelihood low.\n\n40010: Stefania Zanoletti no longer member of S.S.D. Brescia Calcio Femminile. Not known figure; plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n40011: Rodolfo Cota tenure with Mexico national under-20 football team ends Dec 17 2026. Rodolfo Cota is a Mexican goalkeeper, born 1987, currently playing for Club América. He is a player, not a U20 staff. Could be a coach? Unlikely. But could be part of staff? Not impossible but improbable. Likelihood low.\n\n40012: Garfield Smith no longer member of Maryland Terrapins men's basketball team as of Dec 17 2026. Garfield Smith is a real player (born 2003) playing for Maryland. He could leave after season. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n40013: Emil Condurachi no longer member of German Research Foundation as of Dec 18 2026. Emil Condurachi is a researcher? Not known. Could be staff. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n40014: Răzvan Cociș part ways with ACS Poli Timișoara as of Dec 18 2026. Răzvan Cociș is a Romanian footballer, born 1985, retired. ACS Poli Timișoara dissolved in 2018. So organization no longer exists. Therefore impossible. So false, impossible.\n\n40015: Manuel Ortlechner no longer member of ASKÖ Pasching as of Dec 18 2026. Manuel Ortlechner is an Austrian former footballer, retired. ASKÖ Pasching (now known as FC Pasching) existed but lower league. Could be staff. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n40016: Mark Horlings set to leave Yale Bulldogs men's basketball team Dec 20 2026. Mark Horlings? Not known. Could be staff. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n40017: Ehud Keinan tenure at University of Wisconsin–Madison ends Dec 20 2026. Ehud Keinan is a professor (economics) at UW-Madison, still active. Could retire. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n40018: Garry Nensel set to conclude membership with Penn Quakers men's basketball team Dec 20 2026. Garry Nensel? Not known. Could be staff. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n40019: Jim Lynam no longer member of Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens men's basketball team as of Dec 20 2026. Jim Lynam is a former NBA coach, born 1941, would be 85. Unlikely to be on staff. Could be consultant but improbable. But not impossible. Likelihood low.\n\n40020: Rossen Mihaylov Hazarbassanov no longer member of National Evidenc- Based Healthcare Collaborating Agency as of Dec 20 2026. This agency seems fictional. Name also looks fictional. Likely impossible. So false, impossible.\n\nNow assign likelihood categories: \"impossible\", \"low\", \"medium\", \"high\".

Since these are generic statements about individuals leaving or joining organizations on Dec 20, 2026. Many names may be fictional or unknown. The question: \"assess each item and output a JSON object\". We need to decide if scenario could realistically occur in 2026. Since many are plausible (people can leave jobs). Even if the person is fictional, the scenario is not impossible. The instruction: \"If the scenario is absolutely impossible in 2026, then possible_in_2026 = false, otherwise true.\" So unless something contradictory (e.g., date is a Sunday but Dec 20, 2026 is actually a Sunday? Let's check: 2026-12-20 day of week. 2026 is not a leap year. Let's compute: known that 2026-01-01 is Thursday? Actually 2025-01-01 was Wednesday (2024 leap). 2025-01-01 Wednesday, 2025 not leap, so 2026-01-01 Thursday. Then days to Dec 20: Jan 31 days, Feb 28, Mar31, Apr30, May31, Jun30, Jul31, Aug31, Sep30, Oct31, Nov30, Dec20 = sum: Jan31, Feb28=59, Mar31=90, Apr30=120, May31=151, Jun30=181, Jul31=212, Aug31=243, Sep30=273, Oct31=304, Nov30=334, Dec20=354. 354 days after Jan1 inclusive? Actually Jan1 is day 1, so Dec20 is day 354. 354 mod 7 = 354 - 7*50=354-350=4. Starting Thursday (day0?), Let's map: Jan1 Thursday. Add 353 days (since Jan1 is day0). 353 mod7 = 353-7*50=353-350=3. Thursday +3 = Sunday. So Dec20, 2026 is Sunday. So statements about Sunday are correct.\n\nThus timeline feasible.\n\nThus all scenarios plausible unless contradictory like \"Serginho born 1982 leaving club in 2026\" plausible (he would be 44, could still be player? maybe retired but could be staff). Not impossible.\n\nThus all possible_in_2026 = true. Likelihood: Since no evidence, we assign \"medium\" maybe? But we can vary: For generic employment changes, likelihood is \"medium\". For improbable like \"Serginho born 1982 still a player\" maybe \"low\". For \"Veera Bhadra Harish Mandalika leaving Nvidia\" plausible, \"medium\". For \"John Brown no longer a member of Erasmus MC\" plausible, \"medium\". For \"Mike Bell leaving Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball team\" plausible, \"medium\". For \"Courtney Sims starting at Angers SCO\" plausible, \"medium\". For \"George Wilson set to start at Dukla Prague\" plausible, \"medium\". For \"Rudy Verhoeff joined Hillingdon Hospital\" plausible, \"medium\". For \"Vinodh Edward ceased to be employed by Aurum Institute\" plausible, \"medium\". For \"Macarena Gómez De Salazar leaving Idibell\" plausible, \"medium\". For \"Arun Kumar Sharma leaving University of Delhi South Campus\" plausible, \"medium\". For \"Dalila Coelho leaving University of Aveiro\" plausible, \"medium\". For \"Joyce Yamamoto leaving Chrisland University\" plausible, \"medium\". For \"Kiril Dzhorov leaving Hertha BSC\" plausible, \"medium\". For many college basketball players leaving teams: plausible, \"medium\".

Provide JSON with results array in same order. For each, determine possible_in_2026 (true if not impossible). Likelihood categories: impossible, low, medium, high. Provide concise rationale (<=2 sentences). Need to assess factual accuracy: are people real? Many names may be obscure or possibly fictional. If person is real but scenario plausible (e.g., leaving a team) it's possible. If person is deceased or too old, impossible. Also organizations: some may not exist (e.g., Institute Of Fisheries Development? Might be real in Philippines). Need to decide.\n\nWe'll go through each id.\n\n4041: Javier E Contreras-Reyes leaving Institute Of Fisheries Development Dec 22 2026. Is there such a person? Not known publicly. Could be plausible. No impossibility. Likelihood: low to medium? Since unknown but plausible. I'd say medium.\n\n4042: Jesper Grønkjær is a Danish former footballer born 1977, retired. He is not a member of Denmark U19 team (that's a youth team). So scenario impossible (a retired senior player cannot be member). So possible_in_2026 false, likelihood impossible.\n\n4043: John Flanigan to part ways with St. Francis Brooklyn Terriers men's basketball. St. Francis Brooklyn discontinued athletics in 2023 (they dropped program). So team no longer exists. Therefore impossible. possible false.\n\n4044: Demetrius Robinson no longer a member of UNC Greensboro Spartans men's basketball as of Dec 23 2026. Demetrius Robinson is a basketball player born 1994, played at UNC Greensboro earlier, but likely not on team by 2026 (age 32). Could be plausible that he's not a member. So possible true, likelihood low (since unlikely to be on roster). But scenario just states he is no longer a member, which is plausible. Likelihood high? It's a simple departure, plausible. I'd set medium.\n\n4045: Tony Hackworth's tenure in Premier League ends Dec 24 2026. Tony Hackworth is an English footballer born 1976, retired, never played in Premier League (mostly lower leagues). So impossible that he was in Premier League now. So scenario impossible.\n\n4046: Danny Whitlock ended stint in NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Dec 24 2026. Danny Whitlock is a former college player (born 1992) now older, plausible he is not playing. So scenario plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n4047: Jihad Wright no longer member of Campbell Fighting Camels men's basketball as of Dec 24 2026. Jihad Wright is a basketball player (born 1995) played at Campbell, plausible he leaves. So plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n4048: Paul Newman (common name) announced departure from NCAA Division I Men's Basketball effective Dec 25 2026. Paul Newman is a famous actor (died 2008). Not a basketball player. Could be a different Paul Newman, but ambiguous. Likely impossible if referencing famous actor. Since no context, could be a student named Paul Newman. Hard to decide. I'd treat as plausible (someone with that name). Likelihood medium.\n\n4049: Benjamin P Tu part ways with University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center as of Dec 26 2026. Could be a researcher; plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n4050: Babs Olaniyi Kuewumi starts Diploma in Professional Legal Practice Dec 28 2026. Plausible. Likelihood high.\n\n4051: Richard Bates, cricketer from Nottinghamshire, parts ways with Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club effective Dec 29 2026. There is a Richard Bates (born 1994) who played for Nottinghamshire, plausible he leaves. Likelihood medium.\n\n4052: O'Neal ends membership with Jackson State Tigers Basketball Team Dec 29 2026. Could be a player; plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n4053: Towie becomes new member of Bath City FC with transfer on Dec 29 2026. \"Towie\" maybe a nickname for a player? Could be plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n4054: Luca Maria Graf no longer member of FF USV Jena as of Dec 29 2026. FF USV Jena is a German women's handball club; Luca Maria Graf sounds male. Could be plausible but maybe mismatch. Still plausible. Likelihood low-medium. I'd set low.\n\n4055: Stephen R Boona joins FC Dinamo Minsk Dec 29 2026. Unknown person, plausible. Likelihood low-medium.\n\n4056: Al Mcintosh no longer member of Detroit Mercy Titans men's basketball as of Dec 29 2026. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n4057: Sia Anagnostopoulou joins German Research Foundation Dec 29 2026. German Research Foundation (DFG) is a funding organization; individuals become members of committees maybe. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n4058: Isao Matsuoka ends tenure at Fukushima Medical University Dec 29 2026. Isao Matsuoka is a Japanese film executive (born 1937) not a medical professor. Unlikely. Could be another person. But name matches known figure; improbable. I'd mark impossible? Since scenario says tenure at university, unlikely for that person. I'd set unlikely but not impossible? Since could be a different person with same name. I'd set low.\n\n4059: Vera Tsarenko joins Cerezo Osaka Dec 29 2026. Vera is a female name; Cerezo Osaka is a Japanese football club (men's). Could be a female staff or player? Unlikely but possible as staff. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n4060: Orlando Neto tenure with Moreirense FC ends Dec 29 2026.

Provide JSON with results array in same order. For each, we need possible_in_2026 boolean, likelihood (impossible, low, medium, high), and rationale (<=2 sentences). Need to assess factual accuracy, timeline feasibility, real-world plausibility. Many names are obscure; some may be fictional (e.g., Severus Snape). That is impossible because Snape is fictional. Also some clubs may not exist (SV Mattersburg was dissolved in 2015 due to bankruptcy; but maybe reformed? Actually SV Mattersburg was dissolved; unlikely to exist in 2026). So that scenario is impossible. Others: Real Madrid CF is real; Clinton Cuffee is not known as a player; could be plausible as a fictional player? But could be a low-probability but possible. We treat as plausible unless obviously impossible. Also dates: December 29, 2026 is a Tuesday? Let's check: 2026 calendar. 2026 is not a leap year (2024 leap, 2028). Jan 1 2026 is Thursday (I think). Let's compute: 2025 is not leap, Jan 1 2025 is Wednesday? Actually 2024 is leap year, Jan 1 2024 Monday? Let's quickly compute: Known: Jan 1 2023 was Sunday. 2024 is leap, so Jan 1 2024 Monday. 2025 non-leap, Jan 1 2025 Wednesday. 2026 non-leap, Jan 1 2026 Thursday. So Dec 31 2026 would be Thursday? Let's compute days: 2026 has 365 days, Jan 1 Thu, then Dec 31 also Thu (since 365 mod 7 = 1, shift by 1). So Dec 29 would be Tuesday? Dec 31 Thu, Dec 30 Wed, Dec 29 Tue. Yes Tuesday. So many statements say Tuesday Dec 29 2026, consistent. Good.\n\nNow evaluate each item.\n\nWe need to decide likelihood categories: impossible, low, medium, high. If impossible, possible_in_2026 false. Otherwise true.\n\nWe'll go through each id.\n\n4081: René Wagner leaves SV Mattersburg. SV Mattersburg dissolved 2015; unlikely to exist. Could be reformed? Not known. Likely impossible. So possible_in_2026 false, likelihood impossible. Rationale: SV Mattersburg ceased operations in 2015 and has not been re-established, making a 2026 departure implausible.\n\n4082: Eben Thurston departs AC Sparta Prague. No known player Eben Thurston; could be fictional but plausible as a player. AC Sparta Prague exists. Likelihood low to medium? Since name unknown, but could be a low-profile player. So possible true, likelihood low. Rationale: While Sparta Prague is real, there is no public record of a player named Eben Thurston, making the scenario unlikely but not impossible.\n\n4083: Fardaws Aimaq tenure with Mercer Bears men's basketball ends Dec 29 2026. Fardaws Aimaq is a real basketball player (played for Mercer). He could leave in 2026. Likelihood medium to high. Probably plausible. So possible true, likelihood medium/high. Choose medium? Since future unknown but plausible. We'll set high? I'd say medium because uncertain. Use medium.\n\n4084: Mingqing Xiao's tenure at UC Davis ends Dec 29 2026. Could be a staff member; plausible. Likelihood medium. possible true.\n\n4085: Xue Su leaves University of Michigan Dec 29 2026. Could be staff; plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n4086: Chris Rueppell no longer member of Oregon State Beavers men's basketball as of Dec 29 2026. Not known player; plausible low. possible true, likelihood low.\n\n4087: Ahmet Cebe no longer member of Alcorn State Braves basketball as of Dec 29 2026. Not known; plausible low.\n\n4088: Andrea Damiani no longer member of US Pontet Grand Avignon 84 as of Dec 29 2026. US Pontet Grand Avignon 84 is a French football club (maybe). Andrea Damiani could be a player; plausible low-medium. We'll set low.\n\n4089: Diego Rizzotti departs Burlo Garofolo Pediatric Institute Dec 29 2026. Burlo Garofolo is a pediatric institute in Italy. Diego Rizzotti could be staff; plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n4090: Daniel C Castro set to start membership of TSR Olympia Wilhelmshaven Dec 29 2026. Could be a player; plausible low-medium. We'll set low.\n\n4091: Clinton Cuffee to part ways with Real Madrid CF Dec 29 2026. No known player; Real Madrid rarely signs unknown. Likelihood low. possible true.\n\n4092: Mikkel V Olesen parts ways with Bispebjerg Hospital Dec 29 2026. plausible; low-medium.\n\n4093: Severus Snape joins PAOK FC Dec 29 2026.

Not known; plausible low.\n\n4097: Vladislav Davydov tenure with Lokosphinx ends Dec 29 2026. Lokosphinx is a Russian cycling team. Vladislav Davydov could be a cyclist; plausible medium.\n\n4098: Velimir Zajec joins FC Smolensk Dec 29 2026. Velimir Zajec is a former Yugoslav footballer born 1956, retired. Joining a club in 2026 as player impossible due to age (70). Could be staff? The description says \"member\" ambiguous but likely player. Likely impossible as player. We'll treat as impossible. possible false.\n\n4099: Ying-En Ge parts ways with Edinburgh Napier University Dec 29 2026. Could be staff; plausible low-medium.\n\n4100: Bram Braam tenure with FC Wageningen ends Dec 29 2026. FC Wageningen is a Dutch club that dissolved 1992.

Some names may be real athletes, academics, etc. If unknown, we can treat as plausible but uncertain. The scenario is about employment changes on specific date Dec 29 2026. Generally plausible unless impossible (e.g., date mismatch day-of-week). Need to check day-of-week: Dec 29, 2026 is a Tuesday? Let's verify: 2026 is not a leap year (2024 leap, 2025 normal, 2026 normal). Jan 1 2026 is Thursday? Actually 2025 Jan 1 is Wednesday (2024 leap year adds 2 days). 2024 Jan 1 Monday? Let's compute quickly: 2024 is leap, Jan 1 2024 Monday? Actually 2024 Jan 1 is Monday (I think). Then 2025 Jan 1 is Wednesday, 2026 Jan 1 is Thursday. So Dec 31 2026 would be Saturday (since 2026 non-leap, 365 days, Jan 1 Thu, Dec 31 Thu+364 days mod7 = Thu+... 364 mod7 = 0, so Dec 31 also Thursday). Then Dec 30 is Wednesday, Dec 29 is Tuesday. So statements that Dec 29 2026 is Tuesday are correct. Some statements mention Friday Jan 1 2027 as Tuesday Dec 29 2026 (contradiction: Jan 1 2027 is Sunday? Let's compute: 2026 Dec 31 Thu, Jan 1 2027 Fri. Actually if Dec 31 2026 is Thursday, Jan 1 2027 is Friday. So \"Friday, January 1st, 2027: Nick Kirkwood Departs ... a change that occurred on Tuesday, December 29, 2026.\" That's consistent: Jan 1 2027 is Friday, okay.\n\nCheck other day-of-week mismatches: \"Thursday, December 24th, 2026\" - Dec 24 2026 is Saturday? Let's compute: Dec 31 Thu, subtract 7 days = Dec 24 Thu. Actually Dec 31 Thu, minus 7 days = Dec 24 Thu. So Dec 24 2026 is Thursday, correct.\n\n\"Thursday, December 31, 2026\" - Dec 31 is Thursday, correct.\n\n\"Saturday, December 26th, 2026\" - Dec 26 2026 is Monday? Dec 31 Thu, subtract 5 days = Dec 26 Tue? Wait: Dec 31 Thu, Dec 30 Wed, Dec 29 Tue, Dec 28 Mon, Dec 27 Sun, Dec 26 Sat. Yes Dec 26 is Saturday, correct.\n\n\"Monday, January 4, 2027\" - Jan 4 2027 is Monday? Jan 1 Fri, Jan 2 Sat, Jan 3 Sun, Jan 4 Mon, correct.\n\nThus day-of-week matches.\n\nNow plausibility: Many names are obscure; could be real but not widely known. The scenario is typical employment changes; plausible.\n\nPotential impossibility: \"German Research Foundation\" (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) is a funding organization, not an employer of individuals as \"member\". But they have staff; plausible.\n\n\"Gerolsteiner cycling team\" existed historically but disbanded in 2008. So Tom Stamsnijder being a member in 2026 is implausible because team no longer exists. So that scenario is impossible.\n\n\"FK Radnički 1923\" is a Serbian football club; they have players, but \"Kodie Curran\" unknown; plausible.\n\n\"Tim Slade\" is an Australian racing driver, not a footballer; FC U Craiova 1948 is a Romanian football club. Tim Slade being a player there is unlikely but not impossible (career change). Could be improbable but plausible.\n\n\"Portland Pilots men's basketball team\" is University of Portland; Nick Kirkwood unknown; plausible.\n\n\"Per Stig Møller\" is a Danish politician, not a University of Paris staff; but could be a professor; plausible but unlikely. Still possible.\n\n\"Adsorbatmodifizierte Elektroden Und Möglichkeiten Ihrer Anwendung In Der Metallabscheidung\" seems like a German title of a conference or project; being \"located in Ekenäs, Finland\" is odd but could be a research project. Plausible.\n\n\"Meta4\" maybe a company; Neal Mask unknown.\n\n\"Hettingenegyháza departed from Kecskemét\" seems like a Hungarian church? Could be a place; plausible.\n\n\"Lupe o le Soaga SC\" is a Samoan football club; Gene Jones unknown; plausible.\n\nThus only the Gerolsteiner team is clearly defunct. Also \"German Research Foundation\" as \"member\" maybe not typical but still plausible.\n\nThus for each item assign likelihood: high if straightforward employment change; medium if unusual but possible; low if highly unlikely; impossible for Gerolsteiner.\n\nWe'll produce JSON with id as string (convert numeric to string). Provide possible_in_2026 true except id 4102 false.\n\nNow assign likelihood:\n\n4101: Simeon Jovic at German Research Foundation. Unknown person; plausible.

Most are about sports players ending tenure on Dec 31 2026. Need to assess if the person exists and plausible. Many names may be obscure or possibly fictional. We need to decide if scenario is \"absolutely impossible\" (e.g., person dead before 2026, or organization not existing). If uncertain, treat as possible with low/medium likelihood.\n\nWe need to quickly assess each.\n\nLet's go through each ID.\n\n4181: Víctor Cuevas-Vicenttín with Guangdong Southern Tigers (CBA basketball team). Does such a player exist? I haven't heard of Víctor Cuevas-Vicenttín. Could be fictional. Guangdong Southern Tigers exist. Player could plausibly be on team and leave end of 2026. No impossibility. Likelihood low (since unknown). possible_in_2026 = true.\n\n4182: Marine Jeanmougin, Finland U21 football team. Marine is a female name, but U21 football team is male? Could be women's U21? Finland has women's U21? Not typical. Also \"Marine Jeanmougin\" seems fictional. Could be possible but unlikely. possible true, likelihood low.\n\n4183: R. Subramanian at RTI International (research institute). Could be staff leaving. Plausible. Likelihood medium (common). possible true.\n\n4184: Kieron Pollard (real cricketer) with Melbourne Renegades. Pollard retired from international cricket 2022, but still played T20 leagues. By 2026 he would be 44. Could still be contracted? Unlikely but not impossible. He could have been with Renegades earlier (2020-2022). By 2026 likely retired. So scenario of him parting ways on Dec 31 2026 is plausible if he was still on roster; but unlikely. I'd set likelihood low, possible true.\n\n4185: Álvaro Salazar with A.C. Barnechea (Chilean club). Could be plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n4186: Christoph Gasche at UC San Diego. Could be professor or staff. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n4187: Haris Fakić at University of Sydney. Could be academic. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n4188: Paul-Jan Bakker with Hampshire County Cricket Club. Paul-Jan Bakker is a former Dutch cricketer, retired long ago. By 2026 he would be ~60. Could be coach? But \"tenure with club\" as player unlikely. If as staff maybe. But description suggests membership as player. That is impossible because he retired. So likely impossible. possible_in_2026 = false, likelihood impossible.\n\n4189: Hunter Jeffery with Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball. I don't know such player. Could be fictional. Plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n4190: Eldrid Lunden with Levadiakos F.C. Eldrid Lunden is a Norwegian poet, not a footballer. So impossible for him to be a footballer. So scenario impossible. possible false.\n\n4191: Louis Peter Grijp started membership with German Research Foundation (DFG). Louis Peter Grijp is a real linguist, currently a professor. Could become member of DFG (maybe as a reviewer). Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n4192: Taner Yıldız with Bayrampaşa SK (Turkish club). Taner Yıldız is a Turkish politician, not footballer. Could be a different person but name matches. Could be a footballer with same name. Not impossible. Likelihood low-medium. We'll set possible true, likelihood low.\n\n4193: Katherine Osborne-Crowley with UNSW. She is a researcher (child protection). Could be staff leaving. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n4194: Alsény Camara with Al-Ittihad Club (Tripoli). Alsény Camara is a Guinean footballer, could be playing there. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n4195: Nicolas Benezet with Cagliari Calcio. He is a French footballer, currently (2023) at Cagliari? Actually he played for Cagliari earlier? He played for Cagliari 2022-2023? He could be there and leave end 2026. Plausible. Likelihood medium.\n\n4196: Josiah Munda joined Stade Malherbe Caen on Dec 31 2026. I don't know him; plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n4197: Charlie Bell with Rider Broncs men's basketball. Charlie Bell is a former NBA player, retired. By 2026 he would be 45, could be coach. But \"tenure with team\" as player unlikely. Could be staff. But description says \"tenure with the Rider Broncs men's basketball team\". He could be assistant coach. Not impossible. Likelihood low-medium.\n\n4198: Xabi Zusperreguy with Centenary Gentlemen basketball. Unknown name, plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n4199: Dave Bradley with Fairfield Stags men's basketball. Unknown, plausible. Likelihood low.\n\n4200: Josh Leighton with Cal State Fullerton Titans men's basketball. Unknown, plausible. Likelihood low.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nWe need \"likelihood\" values: \"impossible\", \"low\", \"medium\", \"high\". For possible false, likelihood must be \"impossible\".

Most are simple tenure endings or joins. Need to assess factual accuracy: are the people real? Many names likely fictional. If fictional, still plausible? The instruction: \"Base the judgment on general plausibility by 2026 (not certainty).\" If the person is unknown, we can't deem impossible. So plausible unless clearly impossible (e.g., a chateau moving). For Château De Fosseuse moving from Bornel: a building moving is unrealistic. Could be relocation but moving a chateau physically is improbable. So likely impossible.\n\nAlso dates: December 31, 2026 is a Saturday? Let's check: 2026 calendar. 2026 is not a leap year. Jan 1 2026 is Thursday? Actually 2026 Jan 1 is Thursday (2025 is non-leap, 2025 Jan 1 Wed, 2025 not leap, so 2026 Jan 1 is Thursday). Then Dec 31 2026 is Thursday? Let's compute: 2026 has 365 days, Jan 1 Thu, Dec 31 is also Thursday (since 365 mod 7 = 1, so shift by 1 day, so Dec 31 is Thursday).
